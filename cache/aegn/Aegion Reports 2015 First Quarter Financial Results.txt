ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Aegion Corporation (Nasdaq Global Select Market: AEGN) today reported        GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per        diluted share, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in        the first quarter of 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings from continuing        operations, excluding restructuring and acquisition-related expenses,        were $4.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $4.8 million,        or $0.13 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
Charles R. Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer,        commented, “Aegion delivered solid first quarter results as strong        demand in a number of markets offset the adverse impacts of depressed        oil prices on a portion of our upstream business, the strengthening of        the United States dollar against certain foreign currencies and late        winter weather in the United States. The favorable quarterly performance        was the result of strong performance in our Infrastructure Solutions        platform, Energy Services’ downstream refining segment and record        performance associated with the Canadian pipeline construction season.        Contract backlog at March 31, 2015 in these segments support our        expectations for solid performance in the second quarter. However, we        anticipate continuing depressed oil prices will result in reduced        capital spending in the upstream market, which may adversely affect a        portion of our Energy Services’ business, the pipe lining business and        the Canadian pipe coating operations within Corrosion Protection.
“We are continuing to assess the impact of the current oil prices on our        upstream and Canadian oil and gas operations for the second half of        2015, and we expect to gain more clarity over the next few months.        Infrastructure Solutions is well positioned to achieve record operating        performance in 2015. We expect the earnings contribution from this        platform, including savings from our October 2014 restructuring, will        largely offset the continuing weakness from our upstream energy service        operations. We are very pleased with the progress of our 2014        restructuring as it continues to proceed ahead of schedule with pre-tax        savings of $2.5 million recognized in the first quarter. We now        anticipate the annual pre-tax savings in 2015 will be at the high end of        the $8 million to $11 million range as we previously reported.”
2015 Outlook
Infrastructure Solutions
Supporting the favorable outlook for Infrastructure Solutions is backlog        of $354.2 million at March 31, 2015, a 6.7 percent increase over March        31, 2014. Excluding the restructured cured-in-place pipe (“CIPP”)        contracting markets in Europe and Asia, backlog increased by $33.1        million to $346.3 million at March 31, 2015, a 10.6 percent increase        from March 31, 2014. Contract backlog in North America was a record for        backlog in the first quarter and provides the foundation for strong        performance in the second quarter and the second half of 2015. The        Fyfe/Fibrwrap business grew backlog 25.5 percent year-over- year to        $58.2 million led by a large industrial pipeline rehabilitation project        set to begin in the second quarter. Fyfe/Fibrwrap is also benefiting        from the combination with Insituform through its adoption of best        practices in project management and leveraging back-office services.        Investments made in 2014 to create a robust North America sales        organization continue to improve market visibility and support the        objectives for the global Fyfe/Fibrwrap business to grow revenues and        profits this year.
Corrosion Protection
Corrosion Protection anticipates a continuation of pipeline        infrastructure investment in 2015 within the North America midstream oil        and gas pipeline market compared to last year. Backlog at March 31, 2015        was $159.3 million, the same level as backlog at March 31, 2014,        notwithstanding lower demand in the North American upstream market for        Corrosion Protection’s pipeline linings technology and a significant        reduction in backlog for pipe coatings with the conclusion of the winter        Canadian pipeline construction season. The second half outlook for        Corrosion Protection is largely dependent on the outcome of the Canadian        pipe ordering season this summer, along with the level of activity in the North America upstream market. The cathodic protection portion of        the platform expects to increase project activity in the United States        during the second quarter and has secured a more diversified backlog        position in Canada to help offset the expected slowdown in oil pipeline        activity.
Energy Services
Energy Services has a strong market position in the West Coast        downstream refining market, which to date has been largely unaffected by        lower oil prices as refining capacity utilization remains at high        levels. However, approximately 40 percent of Energy Services platform        revenues are in the North American upstream market, which traditionally        generates higher margins than in the downstream segment. Customers in        the Central California upstream markets are reducing costs through        tighter control of maintenance spending, which has negatively impacted        gross margins. The market opportunity for Energy Services in the Permian        Basin upstream market remains favorable in 2015 and supports continuing        investments to build a larger operation in the region. Backlog at March        31, 2015 declined 6.9 percent to $238.2 million from March 31, 2014,        primarily due to the timing of a multi-year upstream contract renewal,        valued at approximately $15 million per year, which was awarded to        Energy Services in April.
 
The following table sets forth our consolidated backlog by segment              (in millions):
 
______________________
(1)
Represents expected revenues to be realized under long-term Master            Service Agreements (“MSAs”) and other signed contracts. If the            remaining term of these arrangements exceeds 12 months, the            unrecognized revenues attributable to such arrangements included in            backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of expected revenues.
 
Realignment and Restructuring Plan
On October 6, 2014, Aegion announced a restructuring plan (“2014        Restructuring”) to exit low-return CIPP contracting businesses and        reduce the size and cost of the Company’s overhead structure to improve        gross margins and profitability over the long term.
In 2014, pre-tax charges were $49.5 million ($36.2 million after-tax, or        $0.95 per diluted share). During the first quarter of 2015, the Company        recorded pre-tax charges of $3.5 million ($3.3 million after-tax), or        $0.09 per diluted share, related to the loss on the sale of Insituform’s        contracting business in France and severance, retention and other cash        items related to the remaining affected contracting markets and Fyfe/        Fibrwrap as a result of the combination with Insituform.
The Company sold its CIPP contracting operations in Switzerland and        France in December 2014 and February 2015, respectively. The sale of        both operations resulted in the execution of multi-year product supply        agreements with the buyers. The sale of the French operation resulted in        a $2.8 million non-cash, pre-tax loss recognized as “Other expenses” in        the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated remaining        pre-tax cash charges, after the charge in the first quarter, is        estimated to be $4 million to $6 million. Activities with respect to        Insituform’s contracting operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore        are expected to be concluded by the end of the third quarter of 2015 as        Insituform completes existing backlog in the affected countries.        Activities with respect to contracting operations in India are expected        to be concluded by the end of the first quarter of 2016. These        restructuring costs relate primarily to employee severance, extension of        benefits, employment assistance programs and other costs.
As previously reported, the 2014 Restructuring is expected to generate        annualized savings of $8 million to $11 million, or $0.15 to $0.20 per        diluted share, on a GAAP basis. Pre-tax savings in the first quarter of        2015 were $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and, to date, the        Company has realized pre-tax savings of $6.0 million, or $0.12 per        diluted share. Based on restructuring savings to date, it is likely the        annual savings will be at the high end of the target range.
Consolidated Highlights
First Quarter 2015 versus First Quarter 2014
(Excludes        pre-tax charges for restructuring and acquisition-related expenses)
Consolidated revenues increased $2.9 million, or 1.0 percent, to $309.2        million. Infrastructure Solutions revenues increased slightly to $122.5        million. Revenues for the North America water and wastewater business        grew mid-single digits, while revenues for the international water and        wastewater business declined because of the decision to exit several        international contracting markets as part of the 2014 Restructuring. In        the United States, late winter weather in the quarter delayed        construction activity for certain operating regions for Infrastructure        Solutions. Revenues for Corrosion Protection declined 5.8 percent,        quarter-over-quarter, to $101.7 million as strong performance in Canada        for the cathodic protection and pipe coatings businesses was offset by        reduced spending in certain portions of the upstream market in North        America, which mainly affected the pipe lining business. Energy Services        grew revenues 11.9 percent to $85.0 million because of an increase in        downstream refining billable hours. Adverse foreign currency translation        rates accounted for a $10.3 million decrease in consolidated revenues,        which affected Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection,        primarily in Canada and Europe.
Consolidated gross profit declined $1.9 million, or 3.1 percent, to        $59.2 million. Infrastructure Solutions gross profit grew 12.0 percent        to $28.6 million. Gross margins expanded 250 basis points to 23.4        percent through revenue growth and improved execution in North America        water and wastewater and improved gross margins for the Fyfe/Fibrwrap        business. Gross profit for Corrosion Protection declined 13.7 percent to        $20.8 million and gross margins declined 190 basis points to 20.5        percent. Strong performance in Canada by the cathodic protection and        pipe coatings businesses was more than offset by weaker activity        associated with reduced spending in the upstream market affecting the        pipe lining business. In addition, the completion of the high margin        coating services Saudi Aramco Wasit project late in 2014, and lower        labor utilization for the cathodic protection and corrosion engineering        business due to typical seasonal low demand in the United States        negatively impacted gross profit dollars, as well as margins. Energy        Services gross profit was $9.8 million, a 14.3 percent decline over the        prior year period. Gross margins contracted 350 basis points to 11.5        percent as a result of a greater mix of lower margin downstream activity        and margin compression in the upstream market as customers controlled        spending and hours because of lower oil prices. Adverse foreign currency        translation impacted Corrosion Protection and Infrastructure Solutions        resulting in a $2.7 million decrease in consolidated gross profit, and        an 86 basis point reduction in gross margins.
Consolidated operating expenses decreased 5.8 percent, or $3.0 million,        to $48.9 million. Infrastructure Solutions reduced operating expenses by        $3.6 million, or 15.1 percent, to $20.5 million, largely due to the 2014        Restructuring and ongoing cost containment efforts. Corrosion Protection        operating expenses were $20.3 million, slightly less than the prior year        period. Energy Services increased operating expense by 10.1 percent to        $8.1 million to support the growth in the downstream segment and to        build the necessary organization to pursue future upstream facility        maintenance opportunities in the Permian Basin. As a percentage of        revenues, the Company's consolidated operating expense ratio decreased        110 basis points to 15.8 percent. Foreign currency translation accounted        for a $0.9 million reduction in consolidated operating expense.
Consolidated operating income increased $1.2 million, or 12.6 percent,        to $10.3 million. Infrastructure Solutions operating income grew by $6.7        million to $8.2 million because of the benefits from the 2014        Restructuring, solid performance for North American water and wastewater        and a $2.7 million year-over- year improvement in operating income for        the Fyfe/Fibrwrap business (excluding corporate expense allocations).        Corrosion Protection operating income declined by $3.2 million to $0.5        million as record performance in Canada was offset by the gross profit        reductions discussed previously. Despite strong revenue growth, Energy        Services operating income declined 59.5 percent to $1.6 million because        of the decline in gross margin rates and business investments for recent        and future growth. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income        by $1.8 million, or 17 percent, and operating margins by 57 basis        points. The adverse currency translation impacts affected the Corrosion        Protection and Infrastructure Solutions platforms.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow used by continuing operations for the first quarter of        2015 was $12.2 million compared to $8.9 million used in 2014. Net        changes in working capital was a $25.8 million use of cash in the first        quarter as vendor payments were higher during the first quarter of 2015        as a result of record business volume in the fourth quarter of 2014.        Notwithstanding the negative net change in working capital, days sales        outstanding on receivables decreased by nearly six days compared to the        first quarter of 2014.
Net cash flow used by investing activities was $11.5 million, compared        to $3.1 million provided in the first quarter of 2014. In the first        quarter of 2015, the Company used $6.5 million, net of cash acquired,        for a small acquisition. The positive cash flow in the first quarter of        2014 was the result of $9.1 million in proceeds received from the sale        of the Company’s 49% ownership interest in Bayou Coating, L.L.C.        following the majority partner’s exercise of its buy-out right. Capital        expenditures were $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to        $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Net cash flows from financing activities used $11.7 million in the first        quarter of 2015 compared to $9.3 million used in the prior year quarter.        During the first quarter of 2015, the Company used $6.2 million to        repurchase 320,000 shares of common stock through open market purchases        and to repurchase shares in connection with the Company’s equity        compensation programs. The Company also made scheduled principal        payments on its long-term debt of $7.0 million.
Net cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was an outflow of $39.0        million, which included a $3.6 million negative impact from currency        exchange rate changes. This compares to an outflow of $14.3 million in        the first quarter of 2014.
