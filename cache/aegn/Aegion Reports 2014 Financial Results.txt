Aegion Reports 2014 Financial Results
Reported 2014 GAAP loss per share from continuing operations, including restructuring and impairment charges recognized in the third and fourth quarters, were a loss of $0.88 per diluted share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.37, up 7.9 percent from 2013.
Reported fourth quarter GAAP loss per share from continuing operations, including restructuring and impairment charges, were a loss of $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.48, up 20.0 percent from the same period in 2013.
Total pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges were $102.3 million in 2014, similar to the estimated $85 to $103 million charge for the strategic realignment and restructuring plan announced on October 6, 2014. The estimated cash restructuring costs are now estimated to be $11 million to $14 million, reduced from the original estimate of $15 million to $18 million.
The October 2014 strategic realignment and restructuring plan generated fourth quarter pre-tax savings of approximately $3.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, versus $0.03-$0.04 per diluted share estimated in October 2014.
Infrastructure Solutions increased 2014 non-GAAP operating income by 54.9 percent to $44.2 million due to of revenue growth and margin expansion.
Corrosion Protection non-GAAP operating income was $27.4 million, below 2013 results, reflecting weaker market conditions in portions of the pipe lining business and the impact of a favorable earnout adjustment in 2013.
Energy Services generated non-GAAP operating income of $13.5 million with a full year ownership of Brinderson.
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014 were a record $175.0 million due to strong cash collections in the fourth quarter.
Consolidated contract backlog as of December 31, 2014 remained strong at $758.0 million, similar to backlog at December 31, 2013, despite exiting several markets.

ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Aegion Corporation (Nasdaq Global Select Market: AEGN) today reported        financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. For the        full year, Aegion reported a loss from continuing operations of $31.6        million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing        operations of $50.8 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in 2013.        Pre-tax restructuring and impairment related charges totaled $102.3        million in 2014, or $2.18 per diluted share. This includes a fourth        quarter 2014 pre-tax charge of $52.7 million, or $1.25 per diluted        share, related to long-term asset impairments, including goodwill.
Excluding the pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges in 2014, as        well as acquisition-related expenses in 2014 and 2013, 2014 non-GAAP1 income from continuing operations was $52.2 million, or $1.37 per        diluted share, compared to $49.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share,        for 2013.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, Aegion reported a GAAP loss from        continuing operations of $33.7 million, or $0.90 per diluted share,        compared to income from continuing operations of $14.5 million, or $0.37        per diluted share, in 2013. Excluding pre-tax restructuring, impairment        charges and acquisition-related expenses, non-GAAP income from        continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $18.2 million,        or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $15.5 million, or $0.40 per        diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Charles R. Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer,        commented, “We met the high end of our revised 2014 guidance with one of        the Company’s strongest operating quarters in recent years. The October        2014 realignment and restructuring plan initiatives are largely behind        us. We also finished the year with a record quarter of cash collections        which enabled us to close the year with the highest cash balance in the        Company’s history. The restructuring efforts are proceeding ahead of        plan, which is reflected in the increased savings realized during the        fourth quarter. There is strong interest in our CIPP products in the        restructured international markets. The restructuring is also complete        at our Louisiana coating facility. The combination of Fyfe/Fibrwrap and        Insituform is also proceeding as planned. We made great progress on        these initiatives during the fourth quarter.
"Infrastructure Solutions had an outstanding year as Insituform’s North        American operations delivered revenue growth and improved profitability        for the third straight year. Fyfe/Fibrwrap generated a profit for 2014        on strong recovery in North America in the second half as well as growth        in Asia. Energy Services grew revenues and operating income        significantly in 2014, reflecting strength in the downstream refining        markets. Corrosion Protection benefited from a strong Canadian market in        2014, as well as a reduction in the operating loss at our coating        facility in Louisiana. This was partially offset by a profit decline in        the energy pipe lining business due to lower revenues.
"2014 was a good year for Aegion, reflecting strong demand for our        products and services. I am particularly pleased with execution across        the enterprise coupled with our successful restructuring initiatives in        the fourth quarter.”
1 Reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP        financial results in this release are on pages 12 to 15. Consolidated        2014 non-GAAP results exclude pre-tax restructuring and impairment related charges summarized on page 4-5. 2014 non-GAAP EPS        excludes: (i) the pre-tax restructuring and impairment related charges;        (ii) $1.4 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for        acquisition-related expenses; (iii) $0.5 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per        diluted share, of expense recorded in connection with the March 31, 2014        sale of the Company’s 49 percent interest in Bayou Coating, L.L.C.,        recorded in “Other income (expense)” on the Consolidated Statement of        Operations; and (iv) $3.0 million pre-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share        charge, representing the net effect of the reserve for disputed and        long-dated accounts receivable and an escrow settlement related to the        Brinderson L.P. acquisition.
2015 Outlook
“As we look to 2015, the majority of our business is well positioned for        stability and growth within the municipal water and wastewater,        commercial infrastructure and the United States midstream pipeline and        downstream refining end markets,” said Mr. Gordon. “The Infrastructure        Solutions platform is projected to have a strong year in 2015 for        operating income growth, particularly in North America where our        continued focus is on delivering superior customer solutions, rigorous        cost management, and improving market intelligence along with attaining        all of the planned restructuring savings.
“Our management teams in Corrosion Protection and Energy Services have        been in contact with our oil and gas customers over the last three        months, a number of whom are understandably cautious and are curtailing        costs. Aegion will be affected by the sharp decline in crude oil prices        because 15 to 20 percent of total revenues are dedicated to the upstream        energy market and there may be some exposure to the midstream market in        Canada. The anticipated earnings contribution from Infrastructure        Solutions and the estimated annual savings from the realignment and        restructuring plan will offset, to a large degree, the likely impact we        may see in 2015. However, at this time, we don’t have sufficient        visibility into the second half of the year, especially with respect to        the Canadian market and the impact of foreign currency translation.        Given the current environment, we are not providing financial guidance        for 2015. We will continue to keep our investors apprised of our overall        positioning in the markets we serve. We are highly confident in the        long-term opportunities for our technologies and services to protect,        rehabilitate and strengthen urban and energy infrastructure, primarily        pipelines, based on demands of aging infrastructure and the expansion of        non-conventional oil and gas recovery in North America and other        regions.”
Infrastructure Solutions
Infrastructure Solutions began 2015 in a strong position with a 2.3        percent increase in backlog from year-end 2013 to $337.5 million at        December 31, 2014 led by 4.8 percent and 16.2 percent backlog increases        for Insituform North America and Fyfe/Fibrwrap, respectively. Offsetting        these increases was the expected decline in international business        backlog as a result of our decision to exit cured-in-place pipe (“CIPP”)        contracting activities in certain countries in Europe and Asia. Current        estimates for 2015 expenditures in the North America municipal CIPP        market indicate mid-single digit growth compared to 2014. Fyfe/Fibrwrap        entered 2015 in a strong backlog position, particularly in North America        through continued focus on improving the sales channel and execution.
Corrosion Protection
Corrosion Protection anticipates continued pipeline infrastructure        investment in 2015 for the midstream oil and gas pipeline market in        North America. Backlog as of December 31, 2014 was $176.0 million, a 9.5        percent increase over backlog as of December 31, 2013. The cathodic        protection business began 2015 with greater backlog than at the        beginning of 2014, and the coating services business has a sizable        backlog, most of which is for a large pipeline project currently        underway in Chile. The actions taken last year to reposition the pipe        coating facility in Louisiana have lowered the required revenue for the        plant to break-even.
The Corrosion Protection market in Canada is under pressure due to the        declining price of oil. This is a critical market for all of our        businesses, and customers have already curtailed spending in certain        upstream activities. Based on current midstream backlog and discussions        we have had with customers, the first half of 2015 should be a strong        finish to the current Canadian pipeline construction season. However,        securing backlog for the second half of the year is less certain. The        pipe ordering season in Canada begins during the summer months and the        pace of orders will be an important indicator as to whether customers        maintain or grow pipeline infrastructure investment for the 2015/2016        winter construction season.
Energy Services
Several new multi-year contracts awarded at the end of 2013 contributed        approximately $70 million in incremental revenues for Energy Services in        2014, primarily in downstream refining, which led in part to record        billable hours and revenues. Reflecting the increased demand, Energy        Services added over 600 new employees to support these new long-term        contracts. In 2015, the downstream market should generate strong results        as demand and favorable pricing for refined petroleum products remain        robust. However, strikes at several West Coast refineries could dampen        results if they continue for an extended period of time. In addition,        demand in the California San Joaquin Valley, Energy Services’ largest        upstream market has been affected by a reduction in capital and        maintenance expenditures, resulting in an 8.8 percent decline in backlog        December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013. While upstream activity        in the Permian Basin has been reduced somewhat in response to lower oil        prices, this market remains an opportunity in 2015 as Energy Services        builds its presence in the region after receiving its first maintenance        contract award in 2014.
Realignment and Restructuring Plan
On October 6, 2014, the Company announced a strategic Realignment and        Restructuring Plan (the “2014 Restructuring Plan”) intended to exit        low-return businesses and reduce the size and cost of our overhead        structure to improve gross margins and profitability in the long term.        The 2014 Restructuring Plan includes the following actions:
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company realigned its          reporting segments by combining Commercial and Structural and Water          and Wastewater to form the Infrastructure Solution segment; forming          the Energy Services segment consisting of Brinderson; and creating the          Corrosion Protection segment with the remaining Energy and Mining          businesses.
Exit Insituform’s contracting operations in France, Switzerland,          India, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.
Optimize operations at the coating facilities in Louisiana, including          the shutdown of under-utilized coating plants, to improve operating          efficiencies and reduce costs.
In 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $49.5 million ($36.2        million after-tax, or $0.95 per diluted share) related to the 2014        Restructuring Plan. Charges recorded during the third and fourth        quarters of 2014 included pre-tax cash charges of $5.6 million and        pre-tax non-cash charges of $43.9 million, including:
A $19.0 million charge associated with the write-down or write-off of          tangible assets primarily related to Insituform’s contracting          activities in France, Switzerland, India, Hong Kong, Malaysia and          Singapore. A $2.7 million charge was recorded for the impairment of          intangible assets in Europe.
For the Bayou Louisiana coating facility, write-down of fixed assets          totaled $11.3 million with an additional $10.9 million associated with          the impairment of certain definite-lived intangibles assets.
Cash charges of $5.6 million for severance, retention and other cash          items related to the affected Insituform contracting markets and          Fyfe/Fibrwrap due to the combination with Insituform.
Additional cash and non-cash charges related to the various restructured        operations could potentially be recorded through the third quarter of        2015.
The Company sold its contracting operations in Switzerland in December        2014 and sold its contracting operations in France in February 2015. The        sale of both operations resulted in the execution of multi-year product        supply agreements with the buyers. Progress in exiting contracting        operations in Singapore and Hong Kong have resulted in lower than        anticipated shut down costs. These favorable developments reduce the        total restructuring cash costs to $11 to 14 million from the original        estimate of $15 to $18 million. The remaining pre-tax cash charge of $5        million to $8 million, after the charge in the third and fourth        quarters, is to be recognized in 2015. These cash costs relate to        employee severance, extension of benefits, employment assistance        programs and other costs.
The effective tax rate on all pre-tax restructuring and impairment        related charges in 2014 was 27.0 percent, which reflected the        non-deductibility of certain charges, along with the impact of valuation        allowances of deferred tax assets due to the likely inability to        generate future taxable income to recover tax losses. Also included are        the estimated tax impacts of write-downs of certain, non-recoverable,        inter-company loans affected by the restructuring initiatives.
The 2014 Restructuring Plan is expected to generate annual savings of $8        to $11 million, or $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share, on a GAAP basis.        Aegion achieved savings in the fourth quarter of $0.07 per diluted share        which is up from the previously estimated $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted        share.
Goodwill Impairment and other Matters
The annual impairment assessment for goodwill resulted in an impairment        charge to recorded goodwill of $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of        2014. Approximately $35 million of the impairment reflects the current        uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, primarily affecting the pipe        coating business in North America and the coating services business in        the more profitable international offshore pipeline market. The        remainder of the goodwill impairment relates to the Fyfe/Fibrwrap        business based solely on the high multiple paid for the business and the        subsequent under performance since 2013 in the North American market.
Management disclosed in the third quarter the possibility of        establishing certain account receivable reserves related to a long-dated        receivables, some of which are currently in litigation or dispute. The        Company recorded a $7.5 million reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014 to        reflect management’s expectations of collection upon settlement of these        matters. The reserve increased the reported fourth quarter operating        expense for Infrastructure Solutions by the amount of the reserve.
The Company reached a settlement with the sellers of Brinderson during        the fourth quarter of 2014 related to escrow claims. The $4.5 million        settlement was recorded as a reduction in operating expense in the        Energy Services segment as the time period has lapsed to record it as        part of the acquisition, which occurred on July 1, 2013.
The net effect of the reserve related to long-dated receivables and the        Brinderson settlement on fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was        an unfavorable pre-tax charge of $1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted        share. These two items do not affect the non-GAAP earnings per share as        shown on pages 12-15 of this release.
Consolidated Highlights
Fourth Quarter 2014 versus Fourth Quarter 2013
(Excludes pre-tax charges for restructuring, impairment and        unusual items in the current quarter and acquisition-related expenses in        the both periods)
Consolidated revenues increased $36.5 million, or 11.6 percent, to        $352.2 million. Infrastructure Solutions revenues increased 3.9 percent,        or $5.4 million, to $145.0 million. Insituform North America grew        revenues by over 10 percent, while revenues for the International CIPP        businesses declined as expected because of the decision to exit six        contracting markets. Fyfe/Fibrwrap grew revenues nearly 35 percent due        to improved sales, despite the delay of two large projects. Corrosion        Protection grew revenues 9.9 percent to $127.3 million on the strength        of the Canadian market across all operations in the platform. Partially        offsetting the revenue growth was a decrease in revenues for the pipe        lining business in North America and the Middle East, after the        completion of several large projects in Oman and Kuwait. The coating        services operation nearly completed the remaining backlog for the Saudi        Aramco/Wasit gas field project and began a large pipe coating project        for internal girth welds for a new processing water mining pipeline in        Chile. Energy Services grew revenues by 32.5 percent to $79.9 million.        Strong billable hours were recorded in both the downstream refining and        the upstream exploration and extraction markets. Partially offsetting        the revenue growth were several upstream project shut down days in        December as a result of unusual weather in the Central California region.
Consolidated gross profit increased $12.9 million, or 18.2 percent, to        $83.8 million. Infrastructure Solutions gross profit grew 30.8 percent        to $40.6 million. Gross margins expanded by 580 basis points to 28.0        percent on improved execution at Insituform North America and        Fyfe/Fibrwrap. Corrosion Protection increased gross profit by $2.9        million, or 10.0 percent, to $32.3 million led by stronger performance        in the Canadian market, across all business lines. Gross margins were        25.4 percent for Corrosion Protection. Energy Services increased gross        profit by 4.1 percent to $11.0 million. Gross margins contracted 380        basis points to 13.7 percent as a result of a greater mix of lower        margin downstream activity and certain underutilized costs in the        upstream business due to unexpected project shutdown days as a result of        unusual weather in December.
Consolidated operating expenses increased 13.8 percent, or $6.7 million,        to $55.0 million. Infrastructure Solutions increased operating expenses        by $1.7 million, or 7.6 percent, to $24.7 million because of investments        to enhance the segment. Corrosion Protection increased operating        expenses by 13.9 percent to $22.2 million because of investments in        people and IT systems to enhance the sales function and expand operating        capabilities in the United States and the Middle East. Energy Services        increased operating expense by 37.7 percent to $8.1 million to support        the build out of critical back office services for the steep growth seen        in 2014 and also to create the necessary organization to expand in the        Permian Basin. As a percentage of revenues, Aegion’s operating expense        ratio increased 30 basis points to 15.6 percent.
Consolidated operating income increased $4.9 million, or 20.6 percent,        to $28.8 million. Infrastructure Solutions grew operating income 90.6        percent to $15.8 million from revenue growth and margin expansion.        Corrosion Protection decreased operating income by 7.6 percent to $10.1        million as a result of an increase in operating expense from investments        to enhance growth opportunities and the fact that the fourth quarter        2013 results included a $1.0 million earnout reversal. Despite strong        revenue growth, Energy Services operating income declined 38.3 percent        to $2.9 million because of the decline in gross margin rates and        additional operating expense investments.
Full Year 2014 versus Full Year 2013
(Excludes pre-tax charges for restructuring, impairment and        unusual items in the current quarter and acquisition-related expenses in the both periods)
Consolidated revenues increased $240.0 million, or 21.9 percent, to        $1.33 billion. The inclusion of a full year of Brinderson accounted for        $197.6 million of the increase as Aegion began to recognize revenues and        profits in the second half of 2013 after the acquisition on July 1,        2013. Infrastructure Solutions grew revenues 7.1 percent, or $37.9        million, to $567.2 million. Insituform North America increased revenues        by double digits because of an increase in the win rate for contract        bidding. Fyfe/Fibrwrap grew global revenues by double digits due to a        recovery in the North America business and stronger results in Asia.        Corrosion Protection grew revenues 1.0 percent to $458.4 million. Strong        market conditions in Canada supported revenue growth for all of the        business lines within the platform. The coating services business grew        revenues from the near completion of the Saudi Aramco/Wasit offshore gas        field project and the start of a large internal girth weld pipeline        coating project in Chile. Nearly offsetting the revenue increase was a        sharp decline in total revenues from the pipe lining business because of        the completion of several large projects in Oman and Kuwait in the prior        year period and delayed project activity in the United States market        throughout 2014, as well as a decrease in revenues from the pipe        coatings operation in Louisiana because of project activity timing.        Energy Services increased revenues 182.6 percent to $305.8 million as a        result of a full year contribution, but also strong growth in both the        downstream refining and upstream exploration and extraction segments.        The downstream segment was the primary beneficiary from the award of        several contracts at the end of 2013, accounting for the majority of the        incremental revenues realized in 2014.
Consolidated gross profit increased $48.7 million, or 19.7 percent, due        to revenue growth as well as gross margin improvement in Infrastructure        Solutions and Corrosion Protection. Gross margins were 22.2 percent, a        40 basis point reduction. The decline in margin largely reflects the        full year contribution of Brinderson business within Energy Services.        The decrease was caused by a 300 basis point reduction in margins to        13.7 percent for Energy Services because of a greater mix of lower        margin downstream billable hours and the up-front costs to add over 600        new employees to support the new maintenance contract awards.
Consolidated operating expense increased by $32.1 million, or 18.0        percent, to $210.6 million, primarily due to having a full year        contribution from Brinderson as well as investments to support growth        opportunities in Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection.        Operating expense within the platforms includes an increase in corporate        services to support a larger organization. As a percent of revenues, the        operating expense ratio improved 54 basis points to 15.8 percent.
Consolidated operating income grew $12.4 million, or 17.0 percent, to        $85.1 million. Infrastructure Solutions grew operating income by 54.9        percent to $44.2 million from strong top line growth and margin        expansion. Corrosion Protection operating income decreased by $9.9        million, or 26.5 percent, to $27.4 million because of investments made        to support future growth and the fact that the Company recognized a $3.9        million earnout reversal in 2013. Energy Services generated operating        income of $13.5 million from having a full year contribution from        Brinderson. Consolidated operating margins were 6.4 percent, a slight        decline from 2013, due in part to a full year contribution from        Brinderson.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2014 was $86.2        million compared to $88.1 million provided in 2013. Net changes in        working capital was a $53.9 million source of cash in the fourth quarter        due to record cash collection. Days Sales Outstanding declined by nearly        10 days compared to December 31, 2013 and by 16 days compared to        September 30, 2014.
