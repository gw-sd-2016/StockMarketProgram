ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Aegion Corporation (Nasdaq Global Select Market: AEGN) today reported        GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $8.7 million, or $0.24 per        diluted share, compared to $12.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in        the second quarter of 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings from        continuing operations, excluding restructuring and acquisition-related        expenses, were $13.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to        $13.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
For the first six months of 2015, reported GAAP earnings from continuing        operations were $10.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to        $17.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the prior year period. On        a non-GAAP basis, earnings from continuing operations for the first six        months of 2015, excluding restructuring and acquisition-related        expenses, were $17.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to        $17.9 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first six months of        2014.
Charles R. Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer,        commented, “Our second quarter 2015 financial results demonstrate        Aegion’s diversified businesses can generate strong results even when        our upstream energy business is under pressure this year from lower oil        prices. Infrastructure Solutions and the downstream portion of Energy        Services delivered strong results in the quarter. Our financial position        remains healthy, with strong first half operating cash flow, and near        record cash balances at the end of June. We estimate the negative impact        on second quarter earnings from certain of our businesses with the most        exposure to the upstream energy sector, was approximately $0.09 per        diluted share, as compared to the prior year.
Our 2014 restructuring efforts remain on track to be substantially        complete by the end of the third quarter of 2015 with approximately $2        million remaining in trailing cash costs. We recognized $0.17 per        diluted share of savings from the start of the initiative through June        30, 2015. We remain on track to recognize annualized savings of        approximately $11 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, at the high-end        of our original expectation.
It is becoming more apparent that the low price range for oil and gas        may continue for some time. As a result, we are evaluating how we may        adapt our upstream technologies and services to better meet this        evolving new reality.
Looking at the balance of the year, which is the seasonally strongest        for a majority of our businesses, we expect the areas of strength that        carried us in the first half of the year will do so again in the second        half. Infrastructure Solutions is on track for record revenues and        profits in 2015 from strong execution and backlog, which is at an        historic high level because of favorable end markets. We also are        benefiting from robust activity in Energy Services’ downstream refining        market due to an increase in refinery maintenance billable hours and the        scheduled execution of previously delayed turnaround projects. There        were positive developments in the last 90 days for Corrosion        Protection’s midstream market, including the award of several large        projects. In particular, Corrpro’s orders have increased significantly,        which is a positive indicator for an expected strong second half of the        year. For the full year, we believe the positive factors driving        performance in 2015 can largely offset the financial impact from the        challenges in the upstream energy market.”
2015 Outlook
Infrastructure Solutions
The Infrastructure Solutions platform is benefiting from increased        expenditures for municipal wastewater pipeline rehabilitation in the        United States, revenue and profit growth from Fyfe/Fibrwrap, the 2014        restructuring and realignment of the international segment and improved        project execution across the platform. Backlog at June 30, 2015 was        $362.9 million, a slight decrease over the prior year period, including        the negative effect of currency translation. However, excluding backlog        for the restructured international markets where Insituform is exiting        contract installation operations, backlog increased 1.9 percent compared        to June 30, 2014. Municipal expenditures for wastewater pipeline        rehabilitation remain at attractive levels led by improved financial        health and several large EPA consent decree enforcement actions in the        United States. Contract backlog for Insituform North America was at a        record level with solid orders during the second quarter. Opportunities        in the North American fiber-reinforced polymer market remain favorable,        reinforcing the outlook for growth in Fyfe/Fibrwrap for 2015.        Restructuring efforts in the six affected international markets continue        to proceed ahead of plan and position the Europe and Asia-Pacific        operations for significant profit growth in 2015. Long-term product        supply agreements have been secured in France, Switzerland, Hong Kong        and Singapore. While Infrastructure Solutions expects only modest        revenue growth, taking into account the revenue decline due to exiting        several international markets, operating income is expected to be at a        record level in 2015 due to gross margin expansion, both domestically        and internationally.
Corrosion Protection
While the mix of revenues and profits for Corrosion Protection favor the        midstream segment, the expected reduction in capital and maintenance        spending within the upstream market has had a significant impact on        platform financial results, which will likely continue in the second        half of 2015. Backlog at June 30, 2015, which was $173.4 million,        represented a 19.5 percent decline compared to June 30, 2014. Excluding        the third quarter 2014 cancellation of a $34.0 million onshore pipe        coating project in the United States, June 30, 2015 backlog declined 4.7        percent compared to June 30, 2014, which includes the negative effect of        currency translation. Pipe orders for the upcoming Canadian construction        season were down significantly indicating a sharp contraction in the        upstream market after record activity in the 2014/2015 construction        season. Market conditions for the upstream pipe linings business remain        under pressure as customers reduce expenditures and competition has        intensified for available projects. The North American midstream market        remains favorable as new orders for the cathodic protection business        increased sharply in June and July. Corrosion Protection backlog        includes $32.0 million of recently announced new awards for midstream        pipe coating projects in the United States Gulf Coast and the Caspian        Sea region, although the timing for project activity in the Middle East        remains a concern due to the impact from lower oil prices. Not included        in reported June 30, 2015 backlog is a large midstream Canadian project,        signed in July 2015, valued at over $10.0 million for alternating        electrical current pipe corrosion mitigation. The reported backlog and        recent awards in the midstream market support a favorable outlook for        the seasonally strong second half of the year. While 2015 should end        with a modest increase in revenues for Corrosion Protection, a        contraction in gross margins will likely result in lower operating        income compared to what was achieved in 2014.
Energy Services
The West Coast downstream refining market continues to be largely        unaffected by the decline in oil prices as demand remains high for        refined petroleum products. This market represents approximately 60        percent of Energy Services’ revenues, mostly for recurring time and        material maintenance activities, and the outlook for the second half of        the year remains favorable. However, the refinery shutdown turnaround        market has been more volatile than expected this year as several, but        not all, planned refinery shutdowns for Energy Services have been        postponed until 2016 to maximize capacity given strong market conditions.
Energy Services’ first half upstream results in the Central California        region declined due to customer-driven cost reductions as a result of        reduced maintenance and capital spending, which will likely continue for        the remainder of the year. Energy Services operations in the Permian        Basin are expected to break-even over the remainder of 2015 as a result        of securing additional small capital construction projects and operating        expense management compared to operating losses during the first half of        the year. As a result of these conflicting market dynamics, backlog for        Energy Services declined 9.7 percent to $224.0 million as of June 30,        2015 compared to June 30, 2014. Energy Services is expected to end 2015        with modest revenue growth due to the strength of the downstream        segment; however, because of lower gross margins during the first half        of the year and less work in the higher margin upstream market, there        will likely be a decline in operating income compared to 2014. Current        planned scheduled maintenance hours, turnaround activity, small capital        construction projects and other services in the second half of 2015        offer the opportunity for gross margin improvement more in line with the        15% run rate achieved in 2014.
 
The following table sets forth our consolidated backlog by segment              (in millions):
 
829.2
______________________
(1) June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014              and June 30, 2014 included backlog from restructured entities of              $3.3 million, $7.9 million, $3.7 million and $12.2 million,              respectively
 
(2) June 30, 2014 included $34.0 million related to an              onshore pipe coating project that was canceled in the third              quarter of 2014.
 
(3) Represents expected unrecognized revenues to be              realized under long-term Master Service Agreements and other              signed contracts.  If the remaining term of these arrangements              exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such              arrangements included in backlog are limited to only the next 12              months of expected revenues.
 
Realignment and Restructuring Plan
On October 6, 2014, Aegion announced a restructuring plan (“2014        Restructuring”) to exit low-return CIPP contracting businesses and        reduce the size and cost of the Company’s overhead structure to improve        gross margins and profitability over the long term.
In 2014, pre-tax charges were $49.5 million ($36.2 million after-tax, or        $0.95 per diluted share). During the first quarter of 2015, the Company        recorded pre-tax charges of $3.5 million ($3.3 million after-tax), or        $0.09 per diluted share, related to the loss on the sale of Insituform’s        contracting business in France, severance, retention and other cash        items related to the remaining affected contracting markets and the        combination of Fyfe/Fibrwrap with Insituform.
A pre-tax charge of $5.7 million ($4.4 million after-tax), or $0.11 per        diluted share, was recorded in the second quarter of 2015 to        substantially complete the shutdown of contracting operations in Hong        Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Non-cash charges totaling $2.6 million        were primarily associated with allowances for the risk of uncollectible        receivables. Cash charges totaling $3.1 million consisted of employee        severance, extension of benefits, employment assistance programs and        other employment-related costs, as well as other restructuring costs.
The 2014 Restructuring was substantially completed in the second quarter        of 2015, with approximately $2.0 million in trailing cash costs expected        in the third quarter of 2015, which will result in total cash charges        for the 2014 Restructuring at approximately $14.0 million, within our        previously announced range.
The 2014 Restructuring is expected to generate annualized savings of        approximately $11.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, on a GAAP        basis. Pre-tax restructuring savings in the second quarter of 2015 were        $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. For the six months ended June        30, 2015, pre-tax savings were $5.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share,        on track to achieve the high-end of the expected annual savings run rate.
Consolidated Highlights
Second Quarter 2015 versus Second Quarter 2014
(Non-GAAP;        excludes pre-tax charges for restructuring and acquisition-related        expenses)
Consolidated revenues increased 4.4 percent to $337.1 million due to        revenue growth in all three platforms. Infrastructure Solutions        increased revenues by 1.2 percent to $149.1 million. Revenues for the        North America water and wastewater business grew low single digits,        while revenues for the international water and wastewater segment        declined more than 20 percent, primarily as a result of exiting several        international contracting markets. The Fyfe/Fibrwrap business increased        revenues by 30 percent, primarily due to a large industrial project in        North America and growth in Asia. Revenues for Corrosion Protection were        $106.0 million, a 3.0 percent increase, as opportunities in the        midstream market were partially offset by revenue declines in the        upstream segment, especially in Canada for pipeline linings and        coatings. Energy Services grew revenues 12.8 percent to $81.9 million on        the strength of the West Coast refining downstream segment, which offset        a revenue decline in the Central California upstream market, which was        directly impacted by lower oil prices. Adverse foreign currency        translation rates accounted for a $10.7 million decrease in consolidated        revenues, which affected Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion        Protection, primarily in Canada and Europe.
Consolidated gross profit increased 1.5 percent to $73.0 million. Gross        margins at Infrastructure Solutions expanded by 240 basis points to 26.8        percent due to strong execution in the water and wastewater business and        Fyfe/Fibrwrap businesses in North America. Gross profit for        Infrastructure Solutions increased 11.3 percent to $40.0 million.        Corrosion Protection gross margins contracted by 370 basis points to        20.6 percent, resulting in a 12.6 percent decline in gross profit to        $21.9 million. Three factors accounted for the decline in gross profit.        First, the impact to revenues and margins from the dramatic drop in oil        prices. Second, the absence of the large and high-margin Saudi Aramco        Wasit project, completed in 2014. Third, lower than expected labor        utilization rates for the cathodic protection business from a slower        ramp-up of project activity in the quarter. The impact of low oil prices        on the North America upstream segment accounted for the 140 basis point        reduction in gross margins to 13.6 percent for Energy Services. Foreign        currency translation adversely impacted Corrosion Protection and        Infrastructure Solutions resulting in a $2.1 million decrease in        consolidated gross profit.
Consolidated operating expense increased $2.1 million, or 4.1 percent,        to $52.8 million. As a percent of revenues, the consolidated operating        expense ratio was 15.7 percent, the same as in the second quarter of        2014. There are a number of factors driving the increase from the prior        year. First, long-term equity compensation expense increased by $1.2        million primarily due to the reversal of compensation costs in the prior        year quarter related to management changes. Second, an allowance for        doubtful accounts of $0.6 million was recorded in the second quarter of        2015 related to certain long dated receivable in dispute with a customer        in the Corrosion Protection segment. A favorable legal judgment was        secured against the creditor but its financial ability to pay the full        judgment amount is now in question. Third, severance-related costs of        $0.7 million were incurred for recent organizational leadership changes        in the Energy Services segment. Excluding the items above, consolidated        operating expense decreased by $0.4 million, or 1.0 percent. This        decrease was primarily driven by savings from the 2014 Restructuring,        totaling $1.9 million, as certain under-performing European and        Asia-Pacific locations were exited and overhead was decreased from        integrating the North American Fyfe/Fibrwrap operations with the        Insituform operations within the Infrastructure Solutions segment.        Partially offsetting the decreases were increased sales expenses and        administrative costs to support growth in certain operations within the        Corrosion Protection and Energy Services segments and increased        corporate related costs including information technology investments to        better integrate the platforms.
Consolidated operating income declined 4.6 percent to $20.2 million as        strong performance in the Infrastructure Solutions platform was offset        by declines in Corrosion Protection and Energy Services. Operating        income for Infrastructure Solutions grew 38.1 percent to $17.8 million.        Again, strong performance for the North America water and wastewater        business, a $3.9 million increase in operating income from        Fyfe/Fibrwrap, benefits from the 2014 Restructuring and ongoing cost        containment efforts accounted the favorable result. The challenges in        the upstream segment were the primary factor for the reduction in        operating income for Corrosion Protection and Energy Services. Operating        income declined $4.5 million to $0.9 million for Corrosion Protection        and declined $1.3 million to $1.5 million for Energy Services. Foreign        currency translation reduced operating income by $0.8 million affecting        Corrosion Protection and Infrastructure Solutions.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by continuing operations was $58.4 million in the        first six months of 2015 compared to $19.0 million provided in prior        year period. Net changes in working capital was a $19.5 million source        of cash compared to a $26.6 million use of cash in the prior year        period. There was an increase in future vendor payments from strong        business volume, while receivables were down significantly as a result        of a concerted effort to increase cash collections. Days sales        outstanding on receivables decreased by more than 15 days from the prior        year. Additionally, during the first half of 2015, we received several        large deposits on pipe coating projects, which accounted for a portion        of the decrease in days sales outstanding.
Net cash flow used by investing activities was $19.4 million in the        first six months of 2015, compared to $5.6 million used in the same        period in 2014. The Company used $6.9 million, net of cash acquired, for        the acquisition of Schultz Mechanical Contractors, Inc. earlier this        year. Capital expenditures were $12.1 million in the first six months of        2015 compared to $13.8 million in the prior year period. In the first        quarter of 2014, the Company received proceeds of $9.1 million for the        sale of the Company’s 49% ownership interest in Bayou Coating, L.L.C.        following the majority partner’s exercise of its buy-out right.
Net cash flows from financing activities used $34.6 million in the first        six months of 2015 compared to $25.2 million used in the prior year        period. During the first half of 2015, the Company used $21.9 million to        repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock through open        market purchases and to repurchase shares in connection with the        Company’s equity compensation programs. The Company also made $13.1        million in scheduled principal payments on its long-term debt during the        first six months of 2015.
Net cash flow for the first six months of 2015 was an outflow of $1.9        million, which included a $6.4 million negative impact from currency        exchange rate changes. This compares to an outflow of $11.9 million in        the first half of 2014.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Aegion has presented certain information in this release excluding        certain items that impacted income, expense and earnings per share from        continuing operations. The non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter        and first six months of 2015 exclude certain charges related to the 2014        Restructuring and acquisition-related expenses. The non-GAAP earnings        per share in the quarter and first six months of 2014 exclude the loss        on sale of the 49 percent interest in Bayou Coating, L.L.C., losses from        discontinued operations and acquisition-related expenses. Aegion        management uses such non-GAAP information internally to evaluate        financial performance for Aegion’s operations because Aegion’s        management believes such non-GAAP information allows management to more        accurately compare Aegion’s ongoing performance across periods. As such,        Aegion’s management believes that providing non-GAAP financial        information to Aegion’s investors is useful because it allows investors        to evaluate Aegion’s performance using the same methodology and        information used by Aegion management.
