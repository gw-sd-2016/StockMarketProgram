("Chipotle" or the "Company") (NYSE: CMG ) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and docketed under 16-cv-00141, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased Chipotle securities between February 4, 2015 and January 5, 2016 inclusive (the "Class Period").

During the week of August 18, 2015, approximately 100 customers and employees of a Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, California became ill. The Ventura County Environmental Health Division reported on September 4, 2015, that the illness was a norovirus outbreak. Health inspectors said that the Chipotle restaurant in question contained dirty and inoperative equipment, equipment directly linked to the sewer, and other sanitary and health violations.

The affected restaurants changed tomato suppliers but did not close their stores.
Additionally, Chipotle closed all of its restaurants in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington, around November 1, 2015, following reports of approximately 20 cases of E. coli by Chipotle patrons. Following this news, Chipotle stock fell $16.23, or approximately 2.5%, to close at $624.00 on November 2, 2015.
