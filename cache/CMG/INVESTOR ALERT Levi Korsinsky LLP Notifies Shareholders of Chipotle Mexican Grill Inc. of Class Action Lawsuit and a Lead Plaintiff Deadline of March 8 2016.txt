NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP:
To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired       securities of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (“Chipotle”) ( CMG ) between       February 4, 2015 and January 5, 2016.
You are hereby notified that a securities class action lawsuit       has been commenced in the USDC for the Southern District of New York. If       you purchased or otherwise acquired Chipotle securities between February       4, 2015 and January 5, 2016, your rights may be affected by this action.       To get more information go to:

or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@zlk.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500, toll-free: (877) 363-5972. There       is no cost or obligation to you.
The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made       materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose       that: (i) Chipotle’s quality controls were not in compliance with       applicable consumer and workplace safety regulations; (ii) Chipotle’s       quality controls were inadequate to safeguard consumer and employee       health; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Chipotle’s public       statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
On January 6, 2016, Chipotle announced that it had been served with a       federal subpoena following August 2014’s criminal investigation of a       dangerous norovirus outbreak at one of its restaurants. This disclosure       follows an E. coli outbreak linked to Chipotle restaurants in late       October and November 2015, and a separate norovirus outbreak at a       location in Massachusetts.
If you suffered a loss in Chipotle you have until March       8, 2016 to request that the Court appoint you as lead       plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that       you serve as a lead plaintiff.
