LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Glancy       Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”)       announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors of       Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (“Chipotle” or the “Company”) ( CMG )       who purchased shares between February 4, 2015 and January 5, 2016,       inclusive (the "Class Period"). Injured investors are encouraged to       contact Lesley Portnoy of GPM at 310-201-9150 to discuss their legal       rights.
The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made       materially misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i)       Chipotle’s quality controls were not in compliance with applicable       consumer and workplace safety regulations; (ii) Chipotle’s quality       controls were inadequate to safeguard consumer and employee health; and       (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Chipotle’s public statements were       materially false and misleading at all relevant times. Over the course       of several disclosures, several news sources and government agencies       revealed that the Company had allegedly failed to properly protect       customers from various food-borne illnesses. The Company’s shares fell       significantly over the course of these disclosures culminating on       January 6, 2016, when the Company disclosed that “Chipotle was served       with a Federal Grand Jury Subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the       Central District of California in connection with an official criminal       investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the       Central District of California, in conjunction with the U.S. Food and       Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations.”
On this news, the Company’s shares fell $33.03 over two trading days, or       7.3%, to close at $416.00 per share on January 7, 2016.
Update: On February 3, 2016, the Company revealed to investors that the       previously disclosed January 6, 2016 subpoena had been expanded in scope       to include information dating back to January 1, 2013. On this news       shares of Chipotle fell an additional $13.93 per share, or nearly 3%, to       close at $461.74 per share on February 3, 2016.
Chipotle investors have until March 8, 2016 to move the Court to       appoint you as lead plaintiff if you meet certain legal requirements.
