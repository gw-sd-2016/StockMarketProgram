“The fourth quarter of 2015 was the most challenging period in        Chipotle’s history, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention        has now concluded its investigation into the recent E. coli incidents        associated with Chipotle. We are pleased to have this behind us and can        place our full energies to implementing our enhanced food safety plan        that will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. We        are extremely focused on executing this program, which designs layers of        redundancy and enhanced safety measures to reduce the food safety risk        to a level as near to zero as is possible. By adding these programs to        an already strong and proven food culture, we strongly believe that we        can establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety just as we have become        a leader in our quest for the very best ingredients we can find,” said        Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle.
Fourth quarter 2015 results
Revenue for the quarter was $997.5 million, a 6.8% decrease compared to        the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a 14.6%        decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The decrease in comparable        restaurant sales was due to publicity during the quarter surrounding        food-borne illness incidents associated with a number of Chipotle        restaurants.
We opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing the total        restaurant count to 2,010.
Food costs were 33.8% of revenue, a decrease of 120 basis points as        compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of relief in dairy,        avocado and beef prices and the benefit of our menu price increase,        partially offset by costs related to food waste and testing.
Restaurant level operating margin was 19.6% in the quarter, a decrease        of 700 basis points from the fourth quarter 2014. The decrease was        primarily driven by the significant decrease in comparable restaurant        sales and non-recurring costs related to the food-borne illness        incidents, partially offset by favorable food costs.
General and administrative expenses were 4.7% of revenue, a decrease of        100 basis points due primarily to lower non-cash stock-based        compensation expense and bonus costs, partially offset by higher wages        as we grew.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $67.9 million, or $2.17        per diluted share, compared to $121.2 million, or $3.84 per diluted        share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of        $2.17 was higher than prior expectations of $1.70 to $1.90 per share        primarily driven by lower non-cash stock based compensation expense        related to vesting of performance shares.
Full year ended December 31, 2015 results
Revenue for the full year of 2015 was $4.5 billion, up 9.6% from the        prior year. The growth in revenue was driven by sales from new        restaurants not yet in the comparable base.
We opened 229 new restaurants during the full year of 2015, bringing the        total restaurant count to 2,010.
Food costs were 33.4% of revenue, a decrease of 120 basis points as        compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the benefit of menu        price increases and relief in dairy and avocado costs. The decrease was        partially offset by inflation on beef.
Restaurant level operating margin was 26.1% for the full year of 2015, a        decrease of 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was        primarily driven by higher labor and other operating costs, partially        offset by lower food costs.
General and administrative expenses were 5.6% of revenue, a decrease of        110 basis points due to decreased non-cash stock-based compensation        expense, lower bonus expense, and decreased expense associated with our        biennial All Managers’ Conference held in the third quarter of 2014,        partially offset by higher wages as we grew.
Net income for the full year 2015 was $475.6 million, or $15.10 per        diluted share, compared to $445.4 million, or $14.13 per diluted share        in the full year 2014.
“2016 will be a very difficult year relative to our past performance.        But, by staying true to our food culture and unique people culture, and        layering on our rigorous food safety program, we are confident that we        are now in a position to aggressively welcome customers into our        restaurants and restore customer confidence in the things that make        Chipotle great. With our full commitment to becoming an industry leader        in food safety, and our continued focus on delivering an exceptional        customer experience, we are confident that Chipotle will emerge as an        even stronger company,” said Monty Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle.
On January 28, 2016, Chipotle was served with a subpoena broadening the        scope of the previously-announced criminal investigation by the U.S.        Attorney’s office for the Central District of California. The new        subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to        company-wide food safety matters dating back to January 1, 2013, and        supersedes the subpoena served in December 2015 that was limited to a        single Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, California. We intend to        fully cooperate in the investigation.
Additionally, our Board of Directors has approved the investment of up        to an additional $300 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase        shares of our common stock. This repurchase authorization, in addition        to up to approximately $178 million available as of January 31 for        repurchases under previously announced repurchase authorizations, may be        modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
Outlook
For 2016, management expects the following:
220-235 new restaurant openings
An effective full year tax rate of approximately 39.0%

About Chipotle
Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea        that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience.        Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos,        burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from        fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking        methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of        Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using        ingredients that are not only fresh, but that—where possible—are        sustainably grown and raised responsibly with respect for the animals,        the land, and the farmers who produce the food. In order to achieve this        vision, we focus on building a special people culture that is centered        on creating teams of top performers empowered to achieve high standards.        This people culture not only leads to a better dining experience for our        customers, it also allows us to develop future leaders from within.        Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in 1993 and operates more than        2,000 restaurants, including 23 Chipotle restaurants outside the US, 13        ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, and is an investor in a        consolidated entity that owns and operates three Pizzeria Locale        restaurants.
