IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW), the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. View photo   Fourth Quarter and Recent Highlights: "We are very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to another successful year, both in financial performance and progress on important new therapies," said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO.  "These positive results were due to continued demand for transcatheter aortic valve replacement therapy, and the strong performance of all product lines this quarter.  We were also pleased to receive FDA approval for our PARTNER 3 Trial to study patients determined to be at low surgical risk, which may eventually enable heart teams to offer a choice of therapies to a broader group of patients." Fourth Quarter 2015 Results Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $671.1 million.  U.S. and international segment sales for the fourth quarter were $353.6 million and $317.5 million, respectively. The strong U.S. dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on reported sales. On an underlying basis, sales grew 15.1 percent over the fourth quarter last year.  Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $140.7 million, or $0.64 per diluted share.    For the fourth quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THV) sales of $334.3 million, a 25.0 percent growth rate over the fourth quarter last year, or $329.8 million and 32.4 percent growth on an underlying basis.  Strong global sales were led by the impact of the SAPIEN 3 valve in the U.S. and double-digit underlying sales growth across all regions. In the U.S., THV sales for the quarter were $193.9 million. On an underlying basis, sales were $189.4 million and grew 49.8 percent compared to the prior year period. "Our THV performance was driven by strong overall procedural growth," said Mussallem. "Based on our momentum and expectation of continued therapy adoption, we now expect our underlying THV sales growth in 2016 to be in the range of 15 to 25 percent." Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group sales for the quarter were $196.2 million. Reported sales decreased 4.8 percent compared to the fourth quarter last year, up slightly over the prior year on an underlying basis. Globally, sales growth was lifted by higher surgical heart valve units, but was lowered by the company's planned exit of non-strategic products. Critical Care product group sales were $140.6 million for the quarter, representing a decrease of 2.6 percent versus last year, and an increase of 3.6 percent on an underlying basis.  For the quarter, the company's gross profit margin was 73.8 percent, compared to 74.0 percent in the same period last year. Results were driven by higher manufacturing expenses, as well as benefits from a favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $222.3 million for the quarter, or 33.1 percent of sales. The modest decrease from the prior year was driven by the favorable foreign exchange impact on expenses outside the U.S., largely offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter valves. Research and development investments for the quarter increased to $98.2 million compared to $84.0 million in the prior year period.  This increase was primarily a result of continued investments in the company's transcatheter mitral and aortic valve programs, including spending on clinical trials. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $103.8 million and included a $33.0 million tax payment related to a previously reported litigation settlement.  After capital spending of $37.5 million, free cash flow was $66.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015.  Total debt was $599.9 million. Twelve-Month Results For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year: Outlook For the full year 2016, the company now expects its total sales to be between $2.60 billion and $2.85 billion. Primarily as the result of increased expectations for sales, the company is raising its adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $2.57 and $2.67.  The company expects a minimal positive impact to 2016 earnings resulting from the recently implemented two-year suspension of the U.S. medical device excise tax, and is evaluating opportunities to accelerate existing growth programs or initiate new ones. For the first quarter of 2016, at current foreign exchange rates, the company projects total sales to be between $640 million and $680 million, and adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.64 and $0.70. "We are very proud of Edwards' performance in 2015 and the momentum we bring into 2016," said Mussallem. "Our focused innovation strategy can transform patient care and drive value to both the healthcare system and shareholders.  We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us for a bright future."

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION Non-GAAP Financial Information To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company uses non-GAAP historical financial measures.  The Company uses the term "underlying" when referring to non-GAAP sales information, which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations, adjustments for discontinued and acquired products, and sales return reserves associated with transcatheter heart valve therapy ("THV") product upgrades, and "adjusted" or "excluding special items" to also exclude gains and losses from special items such as significant investments, impairments, litigation, and business development transactions.  Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an "underlying basis," and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes, and free cash flow are also provided on the same non-GAAP (or "excluding special items") basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items.  The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to expected reported results due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management's inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives. Management does not consider the excluded items or adjustments as part of day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company as they result from transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's core operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below. The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow: THV Sales Return Reserve and Related Costs - In the first and second quarters of 2014, and in the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a net sales return reserve and related costs, primarily related to inventory reserves, of $15.6 million, $6.1 million, and $15.9 million, respectively, related to estimated THV product returns expected upon introduction of next-generation THV products.  The Company recorded a net reversal of these reserves in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 of $2.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 of $16.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, upon delivery of the next-generation THV products. Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses (Income), net - The Company incurred intellectual property litigation expenses of $0.3 million and $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, $1.0 million and $2.6 million in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, $2.4 million and $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $3.3 million and $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In addition, in the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a $750.0 million gain related to an agreement with Medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation. Acquisition of In-process Research and Development - The Company recorded a $10.2 million charge related to the acquisition of transcatheter mitral valve intellectual property in the fourth quarter of 2014. Charitable Foundation Contribution - The Company recorded a $50.0 million charge in the second quarter of 2014 for a charitable contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation. Settlement - The Company recorded a $7.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2014 to settle past and future obligations related to one of its intellectual property agreements. Asset Write-down - The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge in the third quarter of 2014 to write down assets related to its automated glucose monitoring program.  The charge related primarily to intellectual property, fixed assets, inventory and severance expenses. Provision for Income Taxes -  During the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a $6.2 million tax benefit due to the remeasurement of its uncertain tax positions. Foreign Exchange - Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more meaningful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the "Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region." Free Cash Flow - The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.    EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information (in millions, except per share data) RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2015 2014 GAAP Net Income $ 140.7 $ 109.2 $ 494.9 $ 811.1 Growth Rate % 28.8 % (39.0)% Non-GAAP adjustments: (A) THV sales return reserve and related costs (4.4) (3.5) 9.1 2.2 Intellectual property litigation expenses (income), net 3.3 0.6 7.0 (740.4) Acquisition of in-process research and development  10.2  10.2 Charitable foundation contribution    50.0 Settlement    7.5 Asset write-down    5.0 Provision for income taxes Tax effect on reconciling items (B) (0.2)  (6.1) 240.2 Remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserve (A)    (6.2) Non-GAAP Net Income $ 139.4 $ 116.5 $ 504.9 $ 379.6 Growth Rate % 19.7 % 33.0 % RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (C) $ 0.64 $ 0.50 $ 2.25 $ 3.74 Growth Rate % 28.0 % (39.8)% Non-GAAP adjustments: (A), (D) THV sales return reserve and related costs (0.02) (0.01) 0.02  Intellectual property litigation expenses (income), net 0.01  0.02 (2.22) Acquisition of in-process research and development  0.04  0.04 Charitable foundation contribution    0.17 Settlement    0.03 Asset write-down    0.02 Provision for income taxes Remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserve (A)    (0.03) Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.63 $ 0.53 $ 2.29 $ 1.75 Growth Rate % 18.9 % 30.9 % _______________ Note: Numbers may not calculate due to rounding.
