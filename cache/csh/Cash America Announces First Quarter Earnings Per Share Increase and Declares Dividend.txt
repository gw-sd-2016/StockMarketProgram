FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Cash America International, Inc. ( CSH ) announced today that net income from continuing operations for the three-month period ended March        31, 2015 increased to $7,845,000 ($0.27 per share) compared to net        income of $3,237,000 ($0.11 per share) for the same period in 2014.        Included in the reported net income during the 2015 period are expenses        related to closed locations primarily related to the deemphasis of        consumer loan products and severance expenses related to administrative        and operations staff reductions that totaled $1.4 million before taxes        ($854 thousand, or 3 cents per share, after taxes). When excluding these        expenses, adjusted net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP        measure, was $8.7 million (30 cents per share) for the three months        ended March 31, 2015, which is at the high end of the Company’s        published guidance of expected net income per share of between 20 cents        and 30 cents per share from its press release dated January 29, 2015.        Included in the results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 were        expenses primarily related to the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8        million before taxes ($1.1 million, or 4 cents per share, after taxes).        Excluding these expenses, adjusted net income from continuing        operations, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended March 31,        2014 was $4.4 million (15 cents per share).
Consolidated total revenue was $271.8 million for the three-month period        ended March 31, 2015 compared to $284.6 million in the same period in        2014. Consolidated net revenue was $147.1 million during the first        quarter of 2015, compared to $152.5 million for the first quarter of the        previous year. The Company’s net revenue from domestic operations of        $147.1 million for the first quarter of 2015 compares to $149.7 million        for the first quarter of 2014, with the $2.6 million decrease almost        entirely attributable to lower levels of consumer loan fees, net of        losses, due to the strategic decision to eliminate the consumer loan        product in over 300 of the Company’s lending locations during 2014.        Consumer loan fees represented only 7% of the Company’s total revenue of        $271.8 million for the first three months of 2015.
On January 29, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors        approved a 4 million share repurchase authorization. During the first        quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company repurchased 1,148,000 shares,        representing approximately 4% of the fully diluted shares for the year        ended December 31, 2014, at an average price of $22.03 per share in open        market transactions.
Commenting on the first quarter results, Daniel R. Feehan, Chief        Executive Officer of Cash America, said, “Our objectives in the first        three months of 2015 were to emphasize the retail disposition of goods        and to narrow the year-over-year decrease in our domestic pawn loan        balance comparison coming out of tax refund season. We were successful        on both of these objectives. Retail sales of goods within our store        locations increased 7% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same        period in 2014. Domestic pawn loan balances ended the period at $210.1        million at March 31, 2015, compared to $212.9 million during the same        period in 2014, which was 1% below the prior year, but evidencing a        favorable sequential trend as we started the period down 2% as of        December 31, 2014.”
Cash America will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter        results on Thursday, April 30, 2015, at 7:00 AM CDT. A live web cast of        the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the        Company’s corporate web site http://www.cashamerica.com .

Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors, at its        regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, declared a $0.05 (5 cents) per        share cash dividend on common shares outstanding. The dividend will be        paid at the close of business on May 27, 2015 to shareholders of record        on May 13, 2015. This dividend per share is consistent with the dividend        amount per share paid in February 2015 and represents an increase of 43%        from the dividend paid last year in May of $0.035 (3.5 cents per share).
Outlook for the Second Quarter of 2015 and the        2015 Fiscal Year
Management believes that the opportunities for sustained growth in        revenue and earnings will be largely associated with the customer demand        for the credit products provided by the Company, which predominately        take the form of pawn loans and to a lesser extent consumer loans.        During the first quarter of 2015, the typical seasonal decline in loan        balances was consistent with what the Company experienced during the        first quarter of 2014, even though the Federal Income Tax refund season        began a few weeks earlier than the Company anticipated. Typically,        customers use a portion of these refunds to pay back existing loans and        for the purchase of merchandise. At the outset of the second quarter the        Company expects loan balances to begin to recover due to seasonal        factors. The rate of this increase and the timing has a significant        influence on second quarter results. Based on its views on the preceding        factors, management expects that the second quarter 2015 earnings per        share for continuing operations will be between 1 cent and 5 cents per        share compared to a loss of 8 cents per share from continuing operations        in the second quarter 2014, which excludes 33 cents per share mostly        related to the early extinguishment of debt incurred in that period.
At this time, management leaves its previously reported expectations for        its fiscal year 2015 adjusted EBITDA range of between $110 to $125        million, which management estimates will generate between $0.80 to $1.10        in net income per share from continuing operations. This compares to a        reported net loss from continuing operations of 36 cents per share that        included unusual items during the year ended 2014 that totaled 87 cents        per share related primarily to the early extinguishment of debt, a loss        on divestitures and the corporate reorganization costs. Adding back the        unusual items incurred during 2014, adjusted net income from continuing        operations, a non-GAAP measure, for the year ended December 31, 2014        would have been 51 cents per share.
