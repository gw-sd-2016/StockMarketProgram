CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today announced iPad Pro™ is available to order online on       Wednesday, November 11, from Apple.com and will arrive at Apple’s retail stores, select carriers and Apple       Authorized Resellers starting later this week. Apple Pencil™ and Apple’s       new Smart Keyboard, also available to order on Wednesday, bring       breakthrough levels of precision and utility to iPad Pro.
“The early response to iPad Pro from app developers and our customers       has been incredible, and we’re excited to get iPad Pro into the hands of       customers around the world this week,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s       senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPad Pro is the most       powerful iPad we’ve ever made, giving users the ability to be even more       creative and more productive with the epic 12.9-inch Retina display,       powerful 64-bit A9X chip and groundbreaking Apple Pencil and new Smart       Keyboard. We can’t wait to see what they do with iPad Pro.”
The new, larger iPad Pro features a stunning 12.9-inch Retina® display       with 5.6 million pixels, the most ever in an iOS device, and       groundbreaking performance with the new 64-bit A9X chip, rivaling most       portable PCs. It is thin, light and delivers all-day 10-hour battery       life* that users have come to expect from iPad®. Apple Pencil for iPad       Pro makes drawing and sketching feel remarkably fluid and natural, and       delivers incredible accuracy for activities like fine art illustration       and detailed 3D design. A built-in Lightning® connector on Apple Pencil       makes for quick and easy pairing and charging. Apple’s new Smart       Keyboard further extends the utility of iPad Pro, offering a full-sized       keyboard in a thin, durable design so you can take it anywhere. The       Smart Keyboard attaches to iPad Pro’s innovative Smart Connector port,       eliminating the need for a separate battery, on/off switch or Bluetooth       pairing.
iPad Pro has already inspired developers of the next generation of       advanced apps for everything from productivity, design, illustration,       engineering and medical, to education, gaming and entertainment.
“iPad Pro enables new forms of mobile creativity that will help       transform how creatives work,” said Scott Belsky, vice president of       Products at Adobe. “With the larger iPad Pro screen and lightning-fast       performance, creatives will be able to take full advantage of Adobe’s       family of Creative Cloud mobile apps. For example, the ability to       manipulate a 50-megapixel image right on iPad Pro in Photoshop Fix and       then send that image to Photoshop CC on a desktop, for further       refinement, is the kind of industry-advancing collaboration that       millions of Adobe and Apple customers will benefit from.”
“Creative thinkers worldwide use Paper as part of their workflow,       designing everything from flow charts, to storyboards, to wireframes, to       architectural sketches. iPad Pro is the ultimate platform for Paper,       with a powerful 12.9-inch Retina display and A9X chip that deliver       performance rivaling most portable PCs,” said Georg Petschnigg, CEO and       co-founder of FiftyThree. “iPad Pro gives Paper users an even bigger and       more dynamic canvas on which to rapidly capture ideas however they       strike — as notes, photos, sketches or diagrams.”
“Procreate 3 is designed for iPad Pro to give artists a more immersive       experience than ever before,” said James Cuda of Savage Interactive.       “iPad Pro’s gorgeous 12.9-inch Retina display lets you create massive       artworks: up to an incredible 16K in resolution. This new level of       definition allows for large format printing and exceptionally detailed       artworks. Procreate 3 is also built for Apple Pencil. Its remarkable       accuracy, pressure sensitivity, tilt detection and palm rejection make       Apple Pencil the tool we’ve been waiting for.”
“iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are the new pad and pen,” said Evi Meyer, CEO       of 3D sketching app UMake. “With its simple use and powerful computing       capacity, designers can leverage these tools to reimagine their       sketching experience and finally elevate their flat work to 3D. UMake,       iPad Pro and Apple Pencil finally empower professional designers to       embrace innovation, along with their creativity.”
