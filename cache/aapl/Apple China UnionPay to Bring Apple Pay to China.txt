BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® and China UnionPay today announced a partnership to bring Apple       Pay®, which transforms mobile payments with an easy, secure and private       way to pay, to China. China UnionPay cardholders will be able to easily       add their bank cards to Apple Pay on iPhone®, Apple Watch® and iPad®,       providing added convenience and security to everyday shopping.
“China UnionPay is dedicated to promoting payment innovations and       providing secure, convenient mobile payment experiences for its hundreds       of millions of cardholders, aligning multiple parties in the industry,”       said Chai Hongfeng, executive vice president of China UnionPay. “We’re       very excited to offer Apple Pay among a diverse set of innovative       payment options that work with China UnionPay QuickPass.”
“Apple Pay has revolutionized the way millions of people pay every day       with their iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior       vice president of Internet Software and Services. “China is an extremely       important market for Apple and with China UnionPay and support from 15       of China’s leading banks, users will soon have a convenient, private and       secure payment experience.”
China UnionPay’s QuickPass and Apple Pay together will protect customer       payment information through industry-leading payment tokenization       technology. Security is at the core of Apple Pay, so when you add a       credit or debit card, the actual card numbers are not stored on the       device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is       assigned, encrypted and securely stored in a dedicated chip called the       Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is also authorized with       a one-time unique dynamic security code.
Paying is simple with the touch of a finger and can happen in one       motion. In stores, there’s no need to open an app or wake your display.       With the innovative NFC antenna design, simply hold iPhone near China       UnionPay’s QuickPass-enabled POS terminals with your finger on Touch ID®       to pay. With Apple Watch, just double click the side button and hold the       watch face up to the contactless reader to make a purchase right from       your wrist. Shopping within apps accepting Apple Pay has never been       easier and there’s no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or       repeatedly type in shipping and billing information.
Apple Pay will roll out to China UnionPay cardholders as soon as early       2016 after relevant tests and certification required by Chinese       regulators, with the service itself in compliance with the applicable       national mobile payment and financial industry standards in China.
In stores, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6,       iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch. When paying within apps, Apple Pay is       compatible with iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad       Air® 2, iPad mini™ 3, iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro™.
