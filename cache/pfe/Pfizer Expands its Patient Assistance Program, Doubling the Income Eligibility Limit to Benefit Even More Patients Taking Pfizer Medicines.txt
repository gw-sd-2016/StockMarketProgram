NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
In response to the ongoing challenges patients face in paying their       out-of-pocket costs for their prescription medicines, Pfizer announced       today that it will immediately double the allowable income level for its       patient assistance program, so that even more patients in need could be       eligible to receive their Pfizer medicines for free. With this change,       more than 40 medicines offered for free through the program will now be       available to eligible patients earning up to 4 times the Federal Poverty       Level (FPL) adjusted for family size ($47,080 for a single person;       $97,000 for a family of four).
Through its Pfizer RxPathways program, Pfizer offers patients, including       those with health insurance and those without, a range of individual       services to help them gain access to Pfizer medicines. In the last five       years alone (2010-2014), Pfizer has helped nearly 2.5 million uninsured       and underinsured patients get access to more than 30 million Pfizer       prescriptions, making it the most comprehensive program of its kind.
“We have listened to patients and acted quickly to significantly expand       the eligibility of our patient assistance programs. While patient       assistance is not a permanent solution, it is a necessary step for       helping to solve some of the high co-pay issues that some patients face.       The real solution is to have a system that provides patients with access       to innovative new treatments their doctors’ prescribe and insurance       plans with good coverage,” said Sally Susman, executive vice president,       Corporate Affairs at Pfizer.
Pfizer has been helping patients gain access to the Pfizer medicines       they need for more than 25 years. Through Pfizer RxPathways, Pfizer can       also help connect patients to other assistance services the company       offers if they are not eligible to receive their medicines for free.       These programs include:
Savings ranging from 35% to 50% off the retail price on Pfizer         medicines for uninsured patients regardless of income
Medicine access counseling to help patients get connected to the         appropriate Pfizer assistance program
Insurance counseling for select Pfizer medicines to help patients         understand the coverage offered through their insurance plans
Co-pay cards for those with private/commercial insurance and         information on alternate sources of help, like independent co-pay         foundations
Referrals to other industry resources that may help if it is         discovered a patient is not taking a Pfizer medicine
