DARMSTADT, Germany & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer today announced that the        European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal        Products (COMP) has issued a positive opinion for Orphan Drug        designation (ODD) for avelumab*, an investigational fully human        anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, pending an official decision by the        European Commission (EC), expected in December. The COMP positive        opinion is for the cancer immunotherapy avelumab, for the treatment of        Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer.1,2 Each year, there are approximately 2,500 new cases of MCC diagnosed in        the European Union (EU).3 There is currently no therapy        approved specifically for the treatment of metastatic MCC.4
“While significant therapeutic advances have been made against other        types of skin cancer, similar progress has not been made against Merkel        cell carcinoma. There is a great need for effective therapies in this        disease,” said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, Senior Vice President of Clinical        Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer for Pfizer        Oncology. “Orphan Drug Designation is an important regulatory tool that        can help facilitate development of a new treatment option for patients        in Europe with this serious and rare condition.”
The COMP’s positive opinion follows the US Food and Drug        Administration’s ODD for avelumab for the treatment of MCC that was        received in September, Fast Track designation for avelumab for the        treatment of metastatic MCC that was received in October, and        Breakthrough Therapy Designation for avelumab for the treatment of        metastatic MCC that was received in November. In order for a drug to be        granted ODD by the EMA, it must be intended for the treatment,        prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or        chronically debilitating; the prevalence of the condition in the EU must        not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of        the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment        needed for its development; and where no satisfactory treatment is        currently available.
“We are delighted the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has        considered that avelumab matches the Orphan Drug designation criteria        for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the EU,” said Dr. Luciano        Rossetti, Head of Global Research & Development at Merck KGaA,        Darmstadt, Germany’s biopharma business. “We look forward to working        closely with the EMA to make this potential treatment available to        patients as soon as possible, and we eagerly await the results of our        Phase II trial in this rare skin cancer.”
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer are currently conducting a        Phase II study (JAVELIN Merkel 200) to assess the safety and efficacy of        avelumab in patients with metastatic MCC whose disease has progressed        after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. JAVELIN Merkel 200 is a        multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II study with a primary        objective of objective response rate.
The clinical development program for avelumab now includes more than        1,400 patients who have been treated across more than 15 tumor types,        including breast cancer, gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers,        head and neck cancer, MCC, mesothelioma, melanoma, non-small cell lung        cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma and urothelial (e.g.        bladder) cancer.
About the EMA Orphan Drug Designation
An ODD by the EMA allows a pharmaceutical company to benefit from        incentives from the EU to develop a medicine for a rare disease.        Applications for ODD are examined by the COMP, which adopts an opinion        that is forwarded to the EC. The EC then decides whether to grant an        orphan designation for the medicine in question within 30 days of        receipt of the COMP opinion.
Pharmaceutical companies that obtain ODD benefit from a number of        incentives, including protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice specific for designated orphan medicines, and market exclusivity once        the medicine is on the market. Fee reductions are also available,        depending on the status of the sponsor and the type of service required.
*Avelumab is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name for the        anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (MSB0010718C). Avelumab is under clinical        investigation and has not been proven to be safe and effective. There is        no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication        by any health authority worldwide.

About Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)
MCC is a rare and aggressive disease in which cancer cells form in the        top layer of the skin, close to nerve endings. MCC, which is also known        as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin or trabecular cancer, often        starts in those areas of skin that are most often exposed to the sun,        including the head and neck, arms, legs, and trunk. Risk factors for MCC        include sun exposure and having a weak immune system (i.e., solid organ        transplant recipients, people with HIV/AIDS and people with other        cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are at higher risk).        Caucasian males over age 50 are at increased risk. MCC tends to        metastasize at an early stage, spreading initially to nearby lymph        nodes, and then potentially to more distant areas in the body, including        other lymph nodes or areas of skin, lungs, brain, bones or other organs.        Current treatment options for MCC include surgery, radiation and        chemotherapy. Treatment for metastatic or Stage IV MCC is generally        palliative.
About Avelumab
Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational fully human        anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. By inhibiting PD-L1 interactions,        avelumab is thought to potentially enable the activation of T-cells and        the adaptive immune system. By retaining a native Fc-region, avelumab is        thought to engage the innate immune system and induce antibody-dependent        cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In November 2014, Merck KGaA,        Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to        co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab.
