About Eliquis
Eliquis (apixaban) is an oral selective Factor Xa inhibitor. By        inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is        approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and        safety data from seven Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a        prescription medicine indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and        systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation        (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may        lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or        knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce        the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy.
ELIQUIS Important Safety Information and        Indications
 
Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic          reactions)
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature          Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral          anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate          alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events.          An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from          ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation          patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than          pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider          coverage with another anticoagulant.
Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can          cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding.
Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk              of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents,              other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs,              and NSAIDs.
Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report              them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS              in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.
There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of              apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours              after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific              antidote for ELIQUIS is not available.
Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with          ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop          an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or          permanent paralysis.
The risk of these events may be          increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or          the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis.          Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed          earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The          next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours          after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by          traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic          puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.
Monitor          patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent          diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the          potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS          patients.
Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS          have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is          not recommended in these patients.
Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who          Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of          ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin          for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with          hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary          embolectomy.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with          ELIQUIS were related to bleeding.
TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS
ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective          surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of          unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be          discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive          procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be          noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging          anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and          prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be          restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate          hemostasis has been established.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of          cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase          exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients          receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose          of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are          strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole,          itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already          taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with          strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use          of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g.,          rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such          drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of          stroke and other thromboembolic events.
Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of          antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic          NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a          placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute          coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of          aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of          bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo.
PREGNANCY CATEGORY B
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in          pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage          during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy          only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the          mother and fetus.

Indications
ELIQUIS is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism        in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
ELIQUIS is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT),        which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have        undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.
ELIQUIS is indicated for the treatment of DVT and PE, and to reduce the        risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy.
About ARISTOTLE
ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic        Events in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and        safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or        systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120        patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an        active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in        patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at        least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to        treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice        daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or        warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8        years.
