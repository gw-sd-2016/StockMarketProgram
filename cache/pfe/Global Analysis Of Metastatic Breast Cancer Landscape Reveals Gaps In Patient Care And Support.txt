NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Pfizer Inc., working collaboratively with the European School of       Oncology (ESO), within the scope of the Advanced Breast Cancer Third       International Consensus Conference (ABC3), today released the Global       Status of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC): A 2005 – 2015 Decade Report, which       revealed both areas of improvement and substantial gaps in       care, access to resources and support, and treatment outcomes for women       with MBC.
This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151105005508/en/
MBC is the most advanced stage of breast cancer for which there is no       cure.1 Further, public health experts estimate there will be       a 43 percent increase in breast cancer related deaths globally from 2015       to 2030, the majority of which are a result of metastatic disease.2,3 Previous research has shown that women with MBC have distinct needs that       are not often addressed and there are fewer patient and community       resources available for these women compared with those for women with       early-stage disease.4
Over the past decade - due to the collective efforts of the broader       breast cancer community - some progress has been made to address the       unique needs of women with MBC.5,6 However, there is still a       great deal of improvement that needs to be made in this area. The       findings from the Global Status of MBC: A Decade Report reinforce       the urgent need for change in MBC care, patient support, research and       the important role increased disease awareness can play.
This report is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the global       advanced and metastatic breast cancer landscape over the past decade,       and was developed with guidance from a global       steering committee of multidisciplinary leaders in the MBC       community. Results from the preliminary report were presented today at       ABC3 in Lisbon, Portugal.7
As a result of these findings, ESO and members of the breast cancer       community are calling for policymakers, advocates and the medical       community to unite to develop a global charter as a call-to-action       toward changing and improving MBC outcomes by the year 2025.
“As members of the global breast cancer community, we need to change the       way we comprehend, research and prioritize metastatic breast cancer, a       disease that is highly complex clinically and emotionally, yet has       received far less attention than other forms of breast cancer,” said       Fatima Cardoso, MD, director, Breast Cancer Unit at Champalimaud       Clinical Center in Lisbon. “The Global Status of MBC: A Decade Report underscores       the great challenges that continue to exist in the metastatic breast       cancer landscape, and the need for worldwide unity in support of the hundreds of thousands of women living with the disease today.”8,9,10,11
The report includes three newly commissioned primary surveys examining       current perceptions of the state of breast cancer in 34 countries around       the world, including the first survey of global public perceptions of       MBC. Secondary analyses were also conducted, and included an analysis of       existing breast cancer resources and more than 3,000 previously       published articles and abstracts, to determine the global landscape of       MBC over the past decade. This analysis examined several key areas of       MBC patient care and contains the first comprehensive analysis of the       MBC scientific landscape.
“While significant progress has been made in the past few decades in our       understanding of breast cancer, there is an unquestionable need for more       research surrounding metastatic breast cancer worldwide,” said Liz       Barrett, global president and general manager, Pfizer Oncology. “Through       our work, we hope to leverage our scientific expertise and partnerships       with the global breast cancer community to ultimately make metastatic       breast cancer a chronic disease where patients can live with their       condition and thrive as active contributors to their families and       society.”
Beyond the results highlighted in the preliminary report, there is       ongoing analysis of the policy and socioeconomic aspects of MBC, and       additional findings will be presented in 2016.

Primary Survey Highlights
Three new studies evaluating the current state of breast cancer from the       perspective of breast cancer care centers, patient support organizations       and the general population found:
More than half of 582 surveyed oncologists and other healthcare         practitioners in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Australia, report         that they have not been trained on how to effectively deliver         difficult information to their patients and have a desire for more         training.12
The majority of the 50 interviewed patient support organizations in         North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the         Middle East, recognize women with MBC require more support than those         with early-stage disease, but report a range of barriers that can         impact efforts to meet patient needs, including limited resources,         cultural views and logistics.13
There is a global lack of familiarity with metastatic or advanced         breast cancer among the general public leading to widespread         misperceptions about the disease, according to a survey of more than         14,000 people in 14 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, the         Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific.14
The survey also found that among the general public, approximately             1 out of 5 people believe that those with metastatic breast cancer             should keep their diagnosis a secret and not discuss their disease             with anyone other than their physician, potentially contributing             to the stigma that is associated with MBC and leading to feelings             of isolation by the patient.13,15
These findings reinforce results from a 2014 survey conducted by Pfizer       and breast cancer leaders in the United States that found the majority       of Americans (60%) know little to nothing about MBC.16
Secondary Analysis Highlights
An analysis of more than 3,000 previously published articles and       abstracts identified key limitations to progress for women with MBC over       the past decade relating to patient care, the environmental landscape       and scientific research, including:
Despite the benefits of supportive and palliative care to the quality         of life for patients, implementation of supportive care has been         variable across certain countries and significant gaps remain.17,18,19,20,21
Better psychological support for women with MBC is needed to ease the         end-of-life care experience, particularly when it comes to anxieties         about what they may experience.22,23
There has not been a significant improvement in the quality of life         for women with MBC in more than a decade, and there has even been a         slight decrease since 2004.24,25,26,27,28,29
The pace of innovation in MBC appears to have slowed in recent years         with treatment advances, clinical research, publications and guideline         development, particularly when compared with other tumor types, such         as melanoma and lung cancer.30,31,32
About Metastatic Breast Cancer
MBC occurs when cancer spreads beyond the breast to other parts of the       body, including the bones, lungs, liver and brain.1 An       estimated 1.7 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed globally       each year.7 Globally, five to 10 percent of newly diagnosed       breast cancer patients will present with metastatic disease, however, in       low- and middle-income countries 50-80 percent are initially diagnosed       with advanced disease.8 In developed countries, approximately       20-30 percent of women diagnosed with early breast cancer progress to       MBC, and this number may be higher in less developed countries.9,10
