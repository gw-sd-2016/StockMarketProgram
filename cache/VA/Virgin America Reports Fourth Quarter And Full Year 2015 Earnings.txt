SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Virgin America (VA) today reports its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.  Key highlights include: "Virgin America had a very successful 2015," said David Cush, Virgin America's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved the highest net income in company history, generated significant operating cash flow, continued to outperform the industry in domestic unit revenue growth and began growing the airline again. All the while, Virgin America continued to win awards, including being recognized as the 'Best U.S. Airline' in the prestigious annual Condé Nast Traveler's Readers' Choice Awards for the eighth consecutive year. This is a credit to the outstanding service our teammates provide and our unique and  consistent product. We are excited about our growth opportunities in 2016 as we take delivery of five new Airbus A320 aircraft and continue to enhance our ancillary product offering." Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights 1  Please see "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release and the reasons management uses these measures. Operational Highlights 2015 First Quarter 2016 Outlook The Company's expectations for the first quarter of 2016 and full year 2016 are based on currently available information. These expectations are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under "Forward-Looking Statements" below. You should not place undue reliance upon these expectations. Virgin America is scheduled to take delivery of two A320 aircraft during the first quarter of 2016. The Company expects capacity, as measured by available seat miles, to increase by approximately 14.0 percent to 16.0 percent for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Based on current revenue trends, the Company expects PRASM to decrease between 3.0 percent and 5.0 percent versus the first quarter of 2015. The Company expects CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to increase between 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent versus the first quarter of 2015. CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing is increasing in the first quarter due primarily to Virgin America's previously announced pay and benefit initiatives that were implemented in April 2015, partially offset by underlying unit cost improvement as the company resumes capacity growth. The Company continues to expect CASM excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing to decrease between 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent for the full year 2016. Based on Virgin America's hedge portfolio and current market prices for aviation fuel products, the Company expects Virgin America's economic fuel cost per gallon inclusive of related taxes and hedge costs to average between $1.55 and $1.65 for the first quarter of 2016. This number may change depending on fluctuations in market prices for jet fuel during the quarter.

When used in this release, the words "expects," "estimates," "plans," "anticipates," "indicates," "believes," "forecast," "guidance," "outlook," "may," "will," "would," "should," "seeks," "targets" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, statements that describe the Company's objectives, plans or goals, the Company's estimates of financial results or performance or actions the Company may take in the future, are forward-looking statements. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition of its business. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at which or by which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management's good-faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the price and availability of aircraft fuel; the Company's ability to compete in an extremely competitive industry; the successful execution and implementation of the Company's strategy; security concerns resulting from any threatened or actual terrorist attacks or other hostilities; the Company's reliance upon technology and automated systems to operate its business; the potential effects of emergencies, accidents or similar incidents on the Company's reputation and business; changes in economic conditions; the Company's limited profitable operating history; changes in governmental regulations; and the Company's ability to obtain financing or access capital markets. Additional information concerning these and other factors is contained in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Company's forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's views only as of February 18, 2016, and which the Company has no current intention to update. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update them in light of new information or future developments or to release publicly any revisions of these statements in order to reflect later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations The Company evaluates its financial performance using various financial measures, some of which are measures calculated under GAAP, and some of which use alternative methods of calculation (non-GAAP). These measures include operating income/loss, operating margin, net income/loss, net earnings/loss per share and CASM, among others. Pursuant to SEC Regulation G, the Company has included the following reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis.  CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. The Company believes that adjusting CASM for certain special items is useful to investors because the items are not expected to be incurred on a regular basis in future periods. The Company also believes that excluding fuel costs from CASM is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. The Company also believes that reporting economic fuel cost per gallon excluding gains or losses on hedges that related to future periods is useful to investors because such gain or loss is not indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge contract, and the Company believes that excluding such gain or loss helps investors to understand the core operating performance in the current period. In addition, the Company believes that excluding profit sharing costs from CASM better allows investors to understand the core operating cost performance for the period and provides for a more meaningful comparison of the costs of the Company's operations to those of the rest of the industry.    Non-GAAP Statement of Operations and Net Income Excluding Special Items (in thousands except percentages): Three Months Ended December 31, % Twelve Months Ended December 31, % 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change Operating income, as reported $ 20,329 $ 10,095 $ 177,239 $ 96,415 Add: Supplemental rent change in estimate (1) 36,147 — 36,147 — Add (deduct): mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (2) — 2,809 (1,717) 2,809 Add: IPO-related expenses (3) — 20,279 — 20,279 Add: Airport exit costs (4) — 1,040 — 1,040 Operating income, non-GAAP $ 56,476 $ 34,223 65.0 $ 211,669 $ 120,543 75.6 Operating margin, as reported 5.2 % 2.7 % 11.6 % 6.5 % Add: Supplemental rent change in estimate (1) 9.2 — 2.3 — Add (deduct): mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (2) — 0.8 (0.1) 0.2 Add: IPO-related expenses (3) — 5.4 — 1.3 Add: Airport exit costs (4) — 0.3 — 0.1 Operating margin, non-GAAP 14.4 % 9.2 % 5.2 pts 13.8 % 8.1 % 5.7 pts Income before taxes, as reported $ 17,439 $ 4,023 $ 168,150 $ 61,288 Add: Supplemental rent change in estimate (1) 36,147 — 36,147 — Add (deduct): mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (2) — 2,809 (1,717) 2,809 Add: IPO-related expenses (3) — 20,417 — 20,417 Add: Airport exit costs (4) — 1,040 — 1,040 Income before taxes, non-GAAP $ 53,586 $ 28,289 89.4 $ 202,580 $ 85,554 136.8 Net income, as reported $ 190,907 $ 3,872 $ 340,537 $ 60,109 Add: Supplemental rent change in estimate (1) 36,147 — 36,147 — Add (deduct): mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (2) — 2,809 (1,717) 2,809 Add: IPO-related expenses (3) — 20,417 — 20,417 Add: Airport exit costs (4) — 1,040 — 1,040 Deduct: valuation allowance as reported (5) (173,468) — (173,468) — Net income, non-GAAP (6) $ 53,586 $ 28,138 90.4 $ 201,499 $ 84,375 138.8 Add: Pro Forma adjustment for the effect of the 2014 Recapitalization on other expense (7) $ 3,489 Net income, non-GAAP Pro Forma $ 53,586 31,627 69.4     Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP (Continued) Three Months Ended December 31, % Twelve Months Ended December 31, % 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change Fully diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 4.28 $ 0.16 $ 7.66 $ 7.13 Add: Supplemental rent change in estimate (1) 0.81 — 0.81 — Add (deduct): mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (2) — 0.12 (0.04) 0.38 Add: IPO-related expenses (3) — 0.86 — 2.73 Add: Airport exit costs (4) — 0.04 — 0.14 Deduct: valuation allowance as reported (5) (3.89) $ — (3.90) — Fully diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP (6) $ 1.20 $ 1.18 1.7 $ 4.53 $ 10.38 (56.4) Add: Pro Forma adjustment for the effect of the 2014 Recapitalization on other expense (7) 0.15 Deduct: Pro Forma adjustment for the effect of the 2014 Recapitalization to increase outstanding shares (8) (0.62) Fully diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP, Pro Forma $ 1.20 $ 0.71 69.0   (1) Impact of the change in estimate on our aircraft maintenance deposits associated with future maintenance events.
