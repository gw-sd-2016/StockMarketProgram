PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
NRG Yield, Inc. (NYSE:NYLD, NYLD.A) announced it has entered into an        agreement with NRG to acquire 75% of the equity interests in a portfolio        of wind projects consisting primarily of assets acquired by NRG from        Edison Mission Energy in April 2014 (EME Wind Portfolio) for $210        million in total cash consideration, subject to working capital        adjustments, plus assumed project debt of approximately $145 million and        tax equity of approximately $97 million (as of August 1, 2015 on a pro        rata basis).
The EME Wind Portfolio includes the following assets, representing        approximately 814 net megawatts (MW) of total operating capacity:
Elkhorn Ridge – 54 MW wind facility located in Bloomfield, NE
San Juan Mesa – 90 MW wind facility located in Elida, NM
Wildorado – 161 MW wind facility located in Vega, TX
Crosswinds – 21 MW wind facility located in Ayrshire, IA
Forward – 29 MW wind facility located in Berlin, PA

The Company expects these assets to deliver approximately $41 million of        Adjusted EBITDA and $21 million of cash available for distribution        (CAFD) on a run-rate basis1 and provide incremental        geographical and counterparty diversification. At closing, the portfolio        is expected to have an average contracted life of approximately 11 years2 and an average offtaker credit rating of A33. The transaction        is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to receipt of third        party consents and other closing conditions.
The Company is also reaffirming third quarter and full year guidance for        2015 and continues to have the ability to deliver a target 15% dividend        per share growth through 2018, which is not dependent on access to the        equity capital markets.
“NRG Yield continues to remain tactically vital to NRG’s long-term        contracted growth strategy. With this fourth drop-down transaction        from NRG Energy, we continue to deliver on NRG Yield’s growth strategy        and to prove the symbiotic relationship between the two entities,”        said David Crane, NRG Yield's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
