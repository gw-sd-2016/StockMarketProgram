MISSION VIEJO, CA--(Marketwired - December 30, 2014) - Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( AOLS ), a biotechnology company developing compounds to protect against radiological and chemical threats in partnership with the US Government, announced today that David C. Cavalier, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will present at the OneMed Forum SF 2015 Conference on Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 10:50 AM PST (2:50 PM EST) at the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. 
Mr. Cavalier will provide an overview of Aeolus' development programs with a focus on the Company's progress under its contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"). The BARDA contract, worth up to $118.4 million, funds all development costs for the Company's lead compound, AEOL 10150, as a treatment for the pulmonary effects of acute radiation exposure ("Lung-ARS") following a nuclear event.
A webcast of the presentation will be available on the Aeolus web site at www.aolsrx.com .
About Aeolus Pharmaceuticals
Aeolus Pharmaceuticals is developing a new class of broad-spectrum, catalytic-antioxidant compounds that protect healthy tissue from the damaging effects of radiation. Its first compound, AEOL 10150, is being developed, with funding by the US Department of Health and Human Services, as a medical countermeasure against chemical and radiological weapons, where its initial target indications are as a protective agent against the effects of acute radiation syndrome and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure. Aeolus' strategy is to leverage the substantial investment in toxicology, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical studies made by US Government agencies in AEOL 10150, including the contract with BARDA valued, with options, at up to $118.4 million, to efficiently develop the compound for use in oncology. For more information, please visit Aeolus's corporate website at www.aolsrx.com .
About AEOL 10150
AEOL 10150 is a broad-spectrum catalytic antioxidant specifically designed to neutralize reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The neutralization of these species reduces oxidative stress, inflammation, and subsequent tissue damage-signaling cascades resulting from radiation exposure. AEOL 10150 has performed well in preclinical and non-clinical studies, demonstrating statistically significant survival benefit in acute radiation-induced lung injury models, and was well-tolerated in two human clinical trials. The Company believes it could have a profound beneficial impact on people exposed to high-doses of radiation from a nuclear event or in the course of treatment for cancer.
