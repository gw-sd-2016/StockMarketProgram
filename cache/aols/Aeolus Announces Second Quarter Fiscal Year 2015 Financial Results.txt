( AOLS ), a biotechnology company developing compounds to protect against radiological and chemical threats with significant funding from the US Government, announced today financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2015.
The Company reported a net loss of approximately $712,000, or $0.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This compares to a net loss of $437,000, or $0.00 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The Company reported a net loss of approximately $1,410,000, or $0.01 per share for the six months ended March 31, 2015.

"During the quarter, we continued to make progress in the development of AEOL 10150 as both a medical countermeasure against the pulmonary effects of Acute Radiation Syndrome ("Lung ARS") and as a treatment for diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ("IPF")," stated John L. McManus, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In March we met with the Medical Imaging Products Division ("DMIP") at the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ("FDA") to discuss the response to the clinical hold placed on our IND for Lung ARS. The meeting with DMIP greatly clarified and simplified the pathway to addressing the clinical hold and we will provide guidance to investors shortly. Also during the quarter, we received notice from the Office of Orphan Products Development at FDA granting Orphan Drug Designation for AEOL 10150 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We intend to meet with the Respiratory Division of the FDA and then file an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") to begin human clinical trials in this indication. In addition to our work in IPF, we continued to prepare an IND for AEOL 10150 as a treatment to reduce the side effects of radiation therapy for oncology and we intend to meet with the Oncology Division at FDA to discuss that filing in the next few months. Our goal is to have clinical studies in multiple indications underway before the end of the year."
Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015
We had net loss of $712,000 and net loss of $437,000 and cash outflows from operations of $199,000 and $14,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was $1,189,000, which compares to $1,438,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The revenue is from the contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"). Under the BARDA Contract, we generate contract revenue from a cost-plus fee arrangement. Revenues on reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred, which is based on allowable costs incurred during the period, plus any recognizable earned fee. We consider fixed fees under cost-plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract.
Research and Development ("R&D") expenses increased $124,000, or 11%, to $1,297,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 from $1,173,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to work related to the BARDA Contract, including the completion of the large study in non-human primates.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses decreased $98,000, or 14%, to $604,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 from $702,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Stock-based compensation decreased by $123,000 due to lower employee and consultant grants in the current period.
Results of Operations for the six months ended March 31, 2015
We had net losses of $1,410,000 and $1,132,000 and cash outflows from operations of $1,269,000 and $349,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
Revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2015 was $2,114,000, which compares to $2,231,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The revenue is from the BARDA Contract. Since being awarded the BARDA Contract, we generate contract revenue from a cost-plus fee arrangement. Revenues on reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred, which is based on allowable costs incurred during the period, plus any recognizable earned fee. We consider fixed fees under cost-plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract.
Research and Development ("R&D") expenses increased $390,000, or 21%, to $2,270,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2015 from $1,880,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to work related to the BARDA Contract.

About AEOL 10150
AEOL 10150 is a broad-spectrum catalytic antioxidant specifically designed to neutralize reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The neutralization of these species reduces oxidative stress, inflammation, and subsequent tissue damage-signaling cascades resulting from radiation exposure. AEOL 10150 may have a profound beneficial impact on people who have been exposed, or are about to be exposed, to high-doses of radiation in the treatment of oncology.
AEOL 10150 has performed well in preclinical and non-clinical studies, demonstrating statistically significant survival benefit in an acute radiation-induced lung injury model, and was well-tolerated in two human clinical trials. The Company believes it could have a profound beneficial impact on people who have been exposed, or are about to be exposed, to high-doses of radiation, whether from cancer therapy or a nuclear event.
About Aeolus Pharmaceuticals
Aeolus Pharmaceuticals is developing a platform of a new class of broad-spectrum, catalytic-antioxidant compounds that protect healthy tissue from the damaging effects of radiation. Its first compound, AEOL 10150, is being developed, with funding by the US Department of Health and Human Services, as a medical countermeasure against chemical and radiological weapons, where its initial target indications are as a protective agent against the effects of acute radiation syndrome and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure. Aeolus' strategy is to leverage the substantial investment in toxicology, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical studies made by US Government agencies in AEOL 10150, including the contract with BARDA valued, with options, at up to $118.4 million, to efficiently develop the compound for use in oncology.
