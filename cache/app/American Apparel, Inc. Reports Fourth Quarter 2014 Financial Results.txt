Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2014
Loss per share was $0.16 compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of          2013
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.3 million compared to $0.4 million in the          fourth quarter of 2013

Paula Schneider, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our fourth quarter        year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and reduction in operating        expenses position us for a solid turnaround of this business. We remain        focused on putting the right processes and systems in place-such as a        rigorous forecasting process and disciplined bottom-up budgeting-so that        we can better leverage American Apparel's strong brand."
Operating Results - Fourth Quarter 2014
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased $15.6 million, or 9%,        compared to the same period in 2013 due to lower sales in all three        sales channels compared to the same period in 2013.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 decreased 9% to $72.2        million from $79.5 million for the same period in 2013, primarily due to        the lower retail and wholesale sales volume. Gross profit, excluding        significant charges, increased to 52.2% of net sales in the fourth        quarter of 2014 from 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $84.0 million,        compared to $90.7 million for the same period in 2013. Excluding the        effects of significant charges related to customs settlement and        contingencies, the internal investigation of Dov Charney, and employment        settlement and severance costs, operating expenses for the fourth        quarter decreased $10.9 million or 12%, compared to the same period in        2013. The decrease in costs was due to lower payroll and lower costs        related to our advertising and promotional activities from our ongoing        cost reduction initiatives.
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $28.0 million or $0.16 per        share, compared to net loss of $20.8 million, or $0.19 per share for the        fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the fourth quarter of 2014 include        $15.4 million, or $0.09 per share, related to significant charges.        Results for the fourth quarter of 2013 include $4.2 million, or $0.04        per share, related to significant charges.
Significant Charges
Customs settlements and contingencies - We wrote off $3.3 million        of duty receivables for our European subsidiaries based on a        recoverability analysis and probability of collection. These duty        receivables related to changes in transfer costs for product sold to the        European entities.
Internal investigation - On June 18, 2014, the Board of Directors        (the "Board") voted to replace Dov Charney as Chairman of the Board,        suspended him, and notified him of its intent to terminate his        employment as President and CEO for cause. In connection with the        Nomination, Standstill and Support agreement, dated July 9, 2014, with        Standard General and Mr. Charney, the Board formed a new special        committee for the purpose of overseeing the investigation into alleged        misconduct by Mr. Charney. We incurred investigation related legal and        consulting fees of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Employment settlements - In the fourth quarter of 2014, we        entered into settlements of certain previously disclosed        employment-related claims. The settlements resulted in additional        charges totaling $1.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Additional inventory reserves - In late 2014, we initiated        activities to review and improve store merchandising, working capital        and liquidity, and, as such, accelerated the sale of slow-moving        inventory through our retail and online sales channels. As part of this        process, we also identified certain slow-moving, second quality finished        goods and raw materials that required additional reserves. Based on our        review of the inventory on-hand, we increased our excess and        obsolescence reserve by $4.5 million.
Unrealized Gain/Loss on Change in Fair Value of        Warrants
As of December 31, 2014, Lion Capital LLP held warrants to purchase 24.5        million shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $0.66 per        share. As the share price of our stock increases, the fair value of        warrant liability recorded on the balance sheet increases, and we record        an expense to recognize the increase in fair value of the warrant        liability. Conversely, when the share price of our stock decreases, we        record a gain to recognize the related reduction in the fair value of        the warrant liability on the balance sheets. Although the income        statement impacts associated with warrants are appropriate and required        under GAAP, they do not impact our operating performance nor do the        credits and charges have an impact on the cash balances since the        liability recorded is not an obligation that will be settled with cash.        Instead, these warrants will be reclassified to equity when they are        exercised.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.3 million in cash, $34.3 million        outstanding on our asset-backed revolving credit facility and $13.1        million of availability for additional borrowing under the facility. As        of March 13, 2015, we had $5.8 million of availability for additional        borrowings under the facility.
On March 25, 2015, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Capital        One Credit Facility ("the Sixth Amendment") which (i) waived any        defaults under the Capital One Credit Facility due to failure to meet        the obligation to maintain the the obligation to maintain the maximum        leverage ratio and minimum adjusted EBITDA for the measurement periods        ended December 31, 2014, as defined by the credit agreement, (ii) waived        the obligation to maintain the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, the        maximum leverage ratio and minimum adjusted EBITDA required for the        twelve months ended March 31, 2015, (iii) included provisions to permit        us to enter into the Standard General Credit Agreement (as defined        below), (iv) reset financial covenants relating to maintaining minimum        fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, maximum capital        expenditures and minimum adjusted EBITDA, and (v) permitted us to borrow        $15 million under the Standard General Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with the maximum        leverage ratio and the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenants under the        Capital One Credit Facility. For the April 1, 2014 through December 31,        2014 covenant reference period, the maximum leverage ratio was 6.70 to        1.00 as compared with the covenant maximum of 5.10 to 1.00 and the        minimum adjusted EBITDA was $38.2 million as compared with the covenant        minimum of $41.1 million. However, these covenant violations were waived        by the Sixth Amendment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we were        required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less        than 1.00 to 1.00 and a maximum capital expenditure of not more than $8        million. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2014.
On March 25, 2015, one of our subsidiaries borrowed $15 million under an        unsecured credit agreement with Standard General, dated as of March 25,        2015 (the "Standard General Credit Agreement"). The Standard General        Credit Agreement is guaranteed by us, bears interest at 14% per annum,        and will mature on October 15, 2020. The proceeds of such loan are        intended to provide additional liquidity to the Company as contemplated        by the Standstill and Support Agreement.
We believe that we have sufficient financing commitments to make the        April 15, 2015 interest payment as well as meet other funding        requirements for the next twelve months.
Definitions and Disclosures Regarding Non-GAAP        Financial Information
The Company reports and discusses its operating results using financial        measures consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)        and believes that this should be the primary basis for evaluating the        Company's performance.
The preceding discussion of the Company's results of operations includes        a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including the following:        Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization        (Adjusted EBITDA); gross profit, excluding significant charges;        operating expenses, excluding significant charges; and income from        operations, excluding significant charges. These non-GAAP measures        should not be viewed as alternatives or substitutes for GAAP reporting.
The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is        useful to investors because they are used by lenders to measure its        ability to service debt, by industry analysts to determine the market        value of the Company and by management to identify cash available to        service debt, make investments, maintain capital assets and fund ongoing        operations and working capital needs. Additionally, these measures allow        management to gauge company operating performance by isolating the        effects of significant charges.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income or loss from operations plus        income tax provision, interest expense, depreciation and amortization,        share based compensation expense, retail store impairment, and the        effects of significant charges (including changes to the supply chain        operations, certain customs settlements and contingencies, additional        inventory reserves, internal investigation, and employment settlements        and severance), plus or minus unrealized gain or loss on change in fair        value of warrants and foreign currency transaction gain or loss.
Gross profit, excluding significant charges, is calculated as gross        profit less significant charges related to changes to the supply chain        operations - our transition to the La Mirada warehouse in 2013,        additional inventory reserves, and certain custom settlements and        contingencies.
Operating expenses excluding significant charges is calculated as        operating expenses less significant charges related to certain customs        settlements and contingencies, internal investigation, employment        settlements and severance and changes to the supply chain operations.
Loss from operations excluding significant charges is calculated as loss        from operations less significant charges related to certain customs        settlements and contingencies, additional inventory reserves, internal        investigation, employment settlement and severance and changes to the        supply chain operations.
