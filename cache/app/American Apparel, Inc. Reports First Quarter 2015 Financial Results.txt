Paula Schneider, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "American Apparel        is an iconic brand with a loyal customer following and tremendous global        brand awareness. The new executive management team and board of        directors is committed to driving shareholder value and has implemented        the initial phase of a multi-year strategic turnaround plan designed to        improve operating and financial results over the long-term. Key areas of        focus under the plan include infrastructure, operational and financial        planning, expense control, design/product development, retail store        productivity, e-commerce and wholesale optimization, e-commerce        analytics, speed-to-market, and brand building. In the first quarter, we        launched a program to improve the profile of our inventory by        significantly reducing slow-moving merchandise. While we knew this would        have a temporary negative impact on sales and margins, it should improve        store merchandising, working capital and liquidity going forward. We        also launched a merchandising turnaround plan to start replenishing        stores with new styles and product. Also in the quarter, we began the        arduous but vital task of reorganizing and restructuring a number of        critical business processes, including product development, merchandise        planning, operational and financial planning, inventory management,        procurement, and demand planning. We are dedicated to this process and        in the early stages of the strategic turnaround that will require time."
Operating Results - First Quarter 2015
Net sales for the first quarter of 2015 decreased 9% to 124.3 million        from 137.1 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding the year over        year impact from foreign exchange and stores closed in 2014 net sales        decreased 4% for the same period in 2014. First quarter comparable store        sales were negative 5% for both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014.        Negatively impacting comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2015        was a strategic initiative to reduce inventory levels by accelerating        the sale of slow-moving merchandise in the retail stores. This        initiative shifted the merchandise mix in the retail and online stores        towards clearance-related product.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 decreased 34% to $47.5        million from $72 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was        related to discounts related to management’s strategic initiative to        reduce inventory levels by accelerating the sale of slow-moving        inventory, the foreign exchange impact of the strengthening US dollar        and lower retail sales. Gross profit, excluding significant charges,        decreased to 42.0% of net sales in the first quarter of 2015 from 52.5%        in the first quarter of 2014.
Operating expense for the first quarter of 2015 decreased 11% from $79.0        million, compared to $70.3 million for the same period in 2014 due        primarily to lower payroll from our cost reduction efforts and reduced        rent, supplies and miscellaneous activities.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2015 was $26.4 million or $0.15 per        share, compared to net loss of $5.5 million, or $0.05 per share for the        first quarter of 2014. Results for the first quarter of 2015 include        $9.5 million, or $0.05 per share, related to significant charges.
EBITDA add backs
Sale of slow-moving inventory program discounts - In the first        quarter management implemented an initiative to accelerate the sale of        slow moving inventory with a graduated sales discount program through        our retail and online sales channels, as well as through certain        off-price channels. The program resulted in a significant reduction of        slow moving inventory. This program is a part of management’s strategic        shift to change the profile of our inventory and actively reduce        inventory levels to improve store merchandising, working capital and        liquidity.
Internal investigation, litigation and professional fees - We        incurred additional legal, litigation and consulting costs related to        various claims and lawsuits and the sale of the slow moving inventory.
Unrealized Gain/Loss on Change in Fair Value of Warrants
As of March 31, 2015, Lion Capital LLP held warrants to purchase 24.5        million shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $0.66 per        share. As the share price of our stock increases, the fair value of        warrant liability recorded on the balance sheet increases, and we record        an expense to recognize the increase in fair value of the warrant        liability. Conversely, when the share price of our stock decreases, we        record a gain to recognize the related reduction in the fair value of        the warrant liability on the balance sheets. Although the income        statement impacts associated with warrants are appropriate and required        under GAAP, they do not impact our operating performance nor do the        credits and charges have an impact on the cash balances since the        liability recorded is not an obligation that will be settled with cash.        Instead, these warrants will be reclassified to equity when they are        exercised.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2015, we had $20.9 million in cash, $35.1 million        outstanding on our asset-backed revolving credit facility and $11.2        million of availability for additional borrowing under the facility. As        of May 6, 2015, we had $5.2 million of availability for additional        borrowings under the facility.
On March 25, 2015, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Capital        One Credit Facility ("the Sixth Amendment") which (i) waived any        defaults under the Capital One Credit Facility due to failure to meet        the obligation to maintain the obligation to maintain the maximum        leverage ratio and minimum adjusted EBITDA for the measurement periods        ended December 31, 2014, as defined by the credit agreement, (ii) waived the obligation to maintain the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, the        maximum leverage ratio and minimum adjusted EBITDA required for the        twelve months ended March 31, 2015, (iii) included provisions to permit        us to enter into the Standard General Credit Agreement (as defined        below), (iv) reset financial covenants relating to maintaining minimum        fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, maximum capital        expenditures and minimum adjusted EBITDA, and (v) permitted us to borrow        $15 million under the Standard General Credit Agreement.
On March 25, 2015, one of our subsidiaries borrowed $15 million under an        unsecured credit agreement with Standard General, dated as of March 25,        2015 (the "Standard General Credit Agreement"). The Standard General        Credit Agreement is guaranteed by us, bears interest at 14% per annum,        and will mature on October 15, 2020. The proceeds of such loan are        intended to provide additional liquidity to the Company as contemplated        by the Nomination, Standstill and Support Agreement, dated July 9, 2014.
We fulfilled our commitment to make the April 15, 2015 interest payment        of $13.8 million on our senior notes.
Definitions and Disclosures Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company reports and discusses its operating results using financial        measures consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)        and believes that this should be the primary basis for evaluating the        Company's performance.
The preceding discussion of the Company's results of operations includes        a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including the following:        Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization        (Adjusted EBITDA); gross profit, excluding significant charges;        operating expenses, excluding significant charges; and income from        operations, excluding significant charges. These non-GAAP measures        should not be viewed as alternatives or substitutes for GAAP reporting.
The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is        useful to investors because they are used by lenders to measure its        ability to service debt, by industry analysts to determine the market        value of the Company and by management to identify cash available to        service debt, make investments, maintain capital assets and fund ongoing        operations and working capital needs. Additionally, these measures allow        management to gauge company operating performance by isolating the        effects of significant charges.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income or loss from operations plus        income tax provision, interest expense, depreciation and amortization,        share based compensation expense, retail store impairment, and the        effects of significant charges (sale of slow moving inventory, and        internal investigation, litigation and professional fees), plus or minus        unrealized gain or loss on change in fair value of warrants and foreign        currency transaction gain or loss.
Gross profit, excluding significant charges, is calculated as gross        profit less significant charges related to the sale of slow moving        inventory, and internal investigation, litigation and professional fees.
Operating expenses excluding a significant charge is calculated as        operating expenses less significant charges related to the internal        investigation, litigation and professional fees.
Loss from operations excluding a significant charge is calculated as        loss from operations less a significant charge related to the sale of        slow moving inventory, and internal investigation, litigation and        professional fees.
