THOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ( ODFL ) today reported its       results for less-than-truckload (“LTL”) tons per day and revenue per       hundredweight for October and November 2015. LTL tons per day increased       4.4% and 3.1% for October and November 2015, respectively, compared to       October and November 2014. These increases reflected growth in LTL       shipments per day of 9.7% for October 2015 and 8.7% for November 2015 as       compared to the same months in 2014, partially offset by a       year-over-year decline in LTL weight per shipment of 4.8% and 5.2% for       October and November 2015, respectively.
Old Dominion’s LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 1.5% for October       2015 and approximately 0.6% for November 2015 as compared to the same       months in 2014, primarily due to declines in fuel surcharges. Excluding       fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.3% for       October and approximately 6.1% for November 2015 as compared to the same       periods in the prior year.
David S. Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old       Dominion, commented, “Old Dominion continued to produce solid       year-over-year growth in shipments while also improving our yields, net       of fuel surcharges, for the first two months of the fourth quarter of       2015. The domestic economy continues to show some weakness, however,       which is reflected in our volume and weight per shipment trends. We are       pleased with our yield trends and believe that the pricing environment       continues to be stable while demand for our service remains strong. As a       result, we are well-positioned to win additional market share by       continuing to provide premium service at a fair price.”
