THOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ( ODFL ) announced today that Greg       C. Gantt, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating       Officer, has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer.       David S. Congdon will remain the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and       will assume the new responsibilities of Vice Chairman of the Board of       Directors. J. Wes Frye, the Company’s Senior Vice President - Finance       and Chief Financial Officer, has announced his plans to retire from the       Company effective December 31, 2015. Adam N. Satterfield, the Company’s       Vice President - Treasurer, will become the Company’s Chief Financial       Officer effective upon Mr. Frye’s retirement.
David S. Congdon commented, “Old Dominion is quite fortunate to have       someone of Greg’s experience and expertise. Since joining the Company in       1994, he has assumed ever-increasing levels of responsibility for all       aspects of our operations. Greg has played a critical leadership role in       Old Dominion’s growth from a small, regional LTL motor carrier to one of       the five largest LTL companies in the United States. As the Company’s       newly-elected Vice Chairman of the Board and continuing CEO, I look       forward to working with Greg and our Board of Directors as we continue       to enhance the business model that is setting the standard for success       in our industry. On behalf of our entire Old Dominion family, I       congratulate Greg on his well-deserved promotion.”
Mr. Congdon continued, “It would be hard to overstate the pivotal       contributions that Wes Frye has made to Old Dominion in his 30 years as       our CFO. Wes joined Old Dominion when our annual revenue was       approximately $90 million and our operating ratio was in the high 90%       range. He was instrumental in the turnaround of our business, and in       1991 led the Company through its initial public offering. Since that       time, we have grown into one of the country’s leading LTL companies with       $2.8 billion in revenue, an operating ratio of 84.2% and a market       capitalization of over $6 billion at the end of 2014. Our current       financial condition has never been stronger. We thank Wes for his hard       work in helping Old Dominion create an outstanding record of long-term       growth and increased shareholder value, as well as for his dedication,       his counsel and his integrity. Speaking for everyone at Old Dominion, we       wish him well in the years ahead.
“Finally, we are very pleased to announce that Adam Satterfield will       become the Company’s CFO effective upon Wes’s retirement. Adam has been       working with Wes for more than 10 years in positions of increasing       responsibility. Over the past several years, consistent with our       long-term succession planning, Adam has had extensive exposure to the       responsibilities that he will assume as our new CFO. He and Wes will       continue to work closely together for the remainder of 2015 to help       ensure a seamless transition at year- end. We have the utmost confidence       in Adam’s capabilities and look forward to continued financial success       under his leadership.”
