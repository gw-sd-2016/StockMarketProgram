LTL tons per day increased 2.0% and 3.2% for January and February 2016, respectively, compared to January and February 2015. These increases reflected growth in LTL shipments per day of 6.4% for January 2016 and 6.1% for February 2016 as compared to the same months in 2015, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in LTL weight per shipment of 4.1% and 2.7% for January and February 2016, respectively.

Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion, commented, “Old Dominion produced solid growth for the first two months of 2016, despite the ongoing impact of a slow economy and a decline in fuel surcharges. We have continued to take advantage of our opportunities to win market share by delivering superior service at a fair price. In addition, we believe the pricing environment remained stable during the first two months of 2016 and our yield trends were consistent with our expectations.” Forward-looking statements in this news release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
