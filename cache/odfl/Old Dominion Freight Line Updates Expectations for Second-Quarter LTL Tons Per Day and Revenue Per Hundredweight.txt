THOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ( ODFL ) today reported a       year-over-year increase in its less-than-truckload (“LTL”) tons per day       for May 2015 of 9.6%, which followed comparable-period growth of 9.7%       for April 2015. Based on these results, Old Dominion updated its 2015       second-quarter expectations for growth in LTL tons per day to a range of       9.5% to 10.0% over the second quarter of 2014 from the previously       disclosed range of 9.0% to 10.0%. The Company also updated its       expectations for year-over-year growth in LTL revenue per hundredweight,       excluding fuel surcharges, for its second quarter of 2015 to a range of       5.0% to 5.5% from the previously disclosed range of 5.5% to 6.5%.
David S. Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old       Dominion, commented, “We are pleased with the continued growth in our       LTL tons per day, especially with the slowdown of the domestic economy       this year. Our growth is supported by our ability to win market share as       we continue to provide our customers with superior service at a fair       price. We have, however, decreased our second-quarter guidance for       revenue per hundredweight because the year-over-year increase in May was       not as strong as we had anticipated. The quarterly year-over-year       comparison will also be affected by our general rate increase       implemented in May 2014. Our yield metrics for May 2015 were consistent       with those in April 2015, and our updated second-quarter guidance       continues to assume sequential improvement for the quarter. We remain       disciplined with our pricing and believe the industry pricing       environment continues to be stable.”
