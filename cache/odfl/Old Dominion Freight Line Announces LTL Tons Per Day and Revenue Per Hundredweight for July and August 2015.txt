THOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ( ODFL ) today reported its       results for less-than-truckload (“LTL”) tons per day and revenue per       hundredweight for July and August 2015. LTL tons per day increased 7.7%       and 5.8% in July and August 2015, respectively, compared to July and       August 2014. These increases reflected growth in shipments of 12.9% in       July 2015 and 11.7% in August 2015 compared to the same months in 2014,       partially offset by a year-over-year decline in LTL weight per shipment       of 4.6% and 5.3% in July and August 2015, respectively.
Old Dominion also experienced a year-over-year decrease in LTL revenue       per hundredweight of 0.8% for July 2015 and 1.2% in August 2015 compared       to the same months in 2014, primarily due to declines in fuel       surcharges. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges,       increased 5.3% and 5.6% in July and August 2015, respectively, compared       to July and August 2014.
David S. Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old       Dominion, commented, “We are pleased to report the strong growth in our       LTL shipments for July and August, which were consistent with our       long-term growth trends. Our LTL tons per day also continued to grow       against difficult year-over-year comparisons of 18.8% and 19.0% growth       for July and August 2014, respectively, and the continued decline in our       LTL weight per shipment. We believe the pricing environment continues to       be stable and are confident in our ability to continue to gain market       share while also improving our yield.”
