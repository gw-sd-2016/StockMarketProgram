PALATINE, IL--(Marketwired - October 12, 2015) - Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( ACUR ), today announced the receipt of a $2.5 million milestone payment from Egalet Corporation ( EGLT ) triggered by the first commercial shipments of OXAYDO (oxycodone HCI) tablets, a product Egalet licensed from Acura. OXAYDO is an immediate release formulation that incorporates Acura's AVERSION® (abuse-deterrent) Technology.
Acura's AVERSION (abuse-deterrent) Technology is a patented mixture of gelling ingredients and nasal irritants designed to address some common forms of opioid abuse.
Acura's license agreement with Egalet provides for an additional one-time payment of $12.5 million when annual world-wide net sales of OXAYDO first reach $150 million in a calendar year. Acura will also receive a stepped royalty commencing on the first commercial sale at percentage rates from mid-single digits to double digits based on the level of OXAYDO world-wide net sales in a calendar year (including any product line extensions).
