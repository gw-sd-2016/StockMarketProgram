NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Analog        Devices, Inc. today introduced a high-performance clock jitter        attenuator designed to support the JESD204B serial interface standard        for connecting high-speed data converters and field-programmable gate        arrays (FPGAs) operating in base station designs. The JESD204B interface        was specifically developed to address high-data rate system design        needs, and the 3.2-GHz HMC7044 clock jitter attenuator contains        functions that support and enhance the unique capabilities of that        interface standard. The HMC7044 delivers 50-fs jitter performance, which        improves the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of high-speed data        converters, and the device provides 14 low-noise and configurable        outputs that provide flexibility in interfacing with many different        components. The HMC7044 also offers a wide range of clock management and        distribution features that make it possible for designers of base        stations to build an entire clock design with a single device.

In base stations applications there are many serial JESD204B data        converter channels that require their data frames to be aligned with an        FPGA. The HMC7044 clock jitter attenuator simplifies JESD204B system        design by generating source-synchronous and adjustable sample and frame        alignment (SYSREF) clocks in a data converter system. The device        features two phase-locked loops (PLLs) and overlapping, on-chip,        voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). The first PLL locks a low-noise,        local voltage-controlled clock oscillator (VCXO) to a relative noisy        reference, while the second PLL multiplies the VCXO signal up to the VCO        frequency with exceptionally little added noise. For cellular        infrastructure JESD204B clock generation, wireless infrastructure, data        converter clocking, microwave baseband cards and other high-speed        communications applications, the architecture of the HMC7044 offers        excellent frequency generation performance with low phase noise and        integrated jitter.
