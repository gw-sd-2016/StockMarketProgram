NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Analog        Devices, Inc. today introduced an ultralow power buck regulator that        extends battery life in portable devices by achieving the industry’s        highest ultra-light-load power conversion efficiency. With a 90 percent        efficiency rating and consuming only 180-nA quiescent current, the        ADP5301 buck regulator is designed to deliver maximum power for a longer        period of time than previously achievable and is ideally suited for        Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including wireless sensor        networks and wearable devices such as fitness bands and smartwatches.        The new device is housed in a tiny WLCSP package that measures less than        3.1-mm², which makes it suitable for small form factors.
