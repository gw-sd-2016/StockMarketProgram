The AD7124-4 and AD7124-8 incorporate a fully integrated signal chain        with a 24-bit sigma-delta A/D converter, programmable gain amplifier        (PGA), precision reference, reference buffers, current sources,        temperature sensor and excitation sources on a single chip. Integrated        diagnostic features support SIL compatibility and reduce the need for        discrete diagnostic components saving valuable PCB area.
The AD7124-4 and AD7124-8 offer three user-selectable power modes that        allow system designers to optimize throughput rate versus required noise        performance. In the lowest power mode (255 µA) the converter delivers        21.7 noise free bits at low sampling rates. The user-selectable power        modes allow designers of programmable-logic controllers, process        controllers, transmission systems and other industrial and        instrumentation equipment to develop a single platform by precisely        matching power/performance requirements for each use case.
