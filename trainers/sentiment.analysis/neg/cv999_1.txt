NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

TheGrantLawFirm, PLLC is investigating a potential action against Twitter, Inc. (TWTR)(ôTwitterö or the ôCompanyö) and certain of its officers and directors for possible securities fraud in connection with the CompanyÆs statements regarding its net users and advertising revenues during the first quarter of 2015.

Specifically, the investigation focuses on whether, during the period from February 5, 2015 to April 28, 2015, the Company disseminated unduly optimistic and misleading public statements concerning TwitterÆs advertising revenues and revenue growth. It was disclosed on Tuesday, that Twitter sustained a loss of $162 million in the first quarter of 2015, down approximately $30 million from the same period in 2014. In light of this poor earnings report, and the accumulated losses which Twitter has sustained since its inception, questions have further been raised about its use of stock based compensation and the amount of compensation earned by its new chief executive officer. Upon the earnings leak, trading in Twitter was temporarily halted. The stock eventually plunged over 20% and continues to decline. All 15 brokers following the stock cut their price targets. In February 2015, the Company announced increasing revenues along with the announcement of its fourth quarter earnings.
