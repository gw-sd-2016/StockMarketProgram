The CEI is a nationally recognized benchmark that examines the top workplaces in the United States and their inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) employees and their allies. Companies like American that earn the top CEI score of 100 percent also are named the "Best Places to Work" in the U.S.

"We are dedicated to living up to the ideals of the Corporate Equality Index," said Elise Eberwein, American's executive vice president รป People and Communications. "Our commitment begins first and always with the employees who serve as champions for diversity, equality and respect within the company รป and who warmly welcome our loyal LGBT customers every day."

American has a long history of supporting the LGBT community in the course of doing business. For decades, American's Pride Employee Business Resource Group, which was the airline's first employee resource group, has championed LGBT travelers and advocated for diversity, equality and respect within the airline industry. American is also a proud member and supporter of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, PFLAG and Lambda Legal.

The Human Rights Campaign is dedicated to promoting and ensuring public understanding of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues through innovative education and communication strategies. A complete list of CEI rankings is available at hrc.org.
