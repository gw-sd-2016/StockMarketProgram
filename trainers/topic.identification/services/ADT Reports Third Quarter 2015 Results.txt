BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The ADT Corporation ( ADT ) today reported its financial results for        the third quarter of 2015. The Company reported total revenue of $898        million, an increase of 5.8%, or 6.2% in constant currency(1),        compared to the third quarter of 2014. Recurring revenue, which made up        approximately 93% of total revenue in the quarter, was $834 million, up        6.2% compared to the same period last year and up 6.8% in constant        currency(1). Recurring revenue growth in the quarter was        driven by an increase in ADT's new and resale revenue per user, which        rose 2.4% over last year to $48.19, the addition of Reliance Protectron        Inc. ("Protectron"), strong revenue growth by ADT Business and improved        customer retention. Revenue attrition for the quarter improved to 12.4%,        an improvement of 10 basis points sequentially and 150 basis points        year-over-year. Unit attrition for residential and business improved 20        basis points sequentially, and 120 basis points from last year, ending        at 12.3% for the quarter. ADT closed the quarter with 6.6 million        customer accounts, a 4.9% increase over last year. Pre-SAC EBITDA before        special items increased by $16 million to $560 million(1), a        2.9% increase over the prior year, and pre-SAC EBITDA margin before        special items was 66.0%(1). EBITDA before special items        decreased by $1 million to $451 million(1), while EBITDA        margin before special items was 50.2%(1) for the quarter.        EBITDA before special items includes the impact of approximately $6.3        million pre-tax related to the previously disclosed change in the way        the Company accounts for dealer payments for leads generated through its        marketing efficiency program.
The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.47 in        the prior year. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share was        $0.49(1) versus $0.55(1) in the prior year. The        diluted earnings per share of $0.49 also includes the quarterly impact        of approximately $0.02 per share related to the previously mentioned        marketing efficiency program. Using the Company's cash tax rate, diluted        earnings per share before special items was $0.68(1).
Steady-state free cash flow before special items grew to $936 million(1) this quarter, $2 million above prior year. Operating cash flow was $424        million, up 4% from $408 million last year. Excluding special items,        operating cash flow was $435million(1), a $25        million increase over prior year. Free cash flow before special items        was $99 million(1) in the quarter, up $1 million when        compared to the same period last year, despite an increase in gross        subscriber additions of approximately 5%.
"I'm pleased with the progress we're making and the encouraging trends        we see developing creating opportunities for profitable growth in the        future," said Naren Gursahaney, ADT's chief executive officer. "Gross        adds were up versus prior year, revenue growth is strong, and we're        continuing to improve the efficiency of adding new customers. Our        primary focus continues to be on enhancing the customer experience, and        our efforts are paying off as we again improved revenue and unit        attrition. We're investing to capitalize on growth opportunities by        launching new products and services, building capabilities to        participate in new market segments, and establishing exciting new        partnerships. This quarter we announced a new partnership with Nest        Labs, expanding our Pulse ecosystem and giving our Pulse customers the        security they need along with the smart home technologies they desire,        all powered by our newly released ADT Pulse mobile app. And, earlier        this month, our Board authorized an incremental 3 year, $1 billion share        repurchase program, reinforcing our confidence in future cash generation        and in our long term strategy."
PROGRESS ON 2015 PRIORITIES: DELIVERING ON GROWTH INITIATIVES
Improving customer retention - The Company continued to improve          attrition, including reducing the percentage of voluntary and lost to          competition disconnects compared to last year. Revenue attrition in          the quarter improved to 12.4% - a 10 basis point improvement          sequentially and 150 basis points below prior year, and unit attrition          in our residential and business channel was 12.3% - a 20 basis point          improvement sequentially and 120 basis points below the same period          last year.
Tenure screening and non-pay initiatives continue to              deliver improvements in non-pay disconnects. Company screened out              approximately 4,000 lower quality potential customers in the              quarter.
Stronger resale efforts have led to a 30% improvement in              resales over the prior year.
Driving increases in ADT Pulse - Pulse customers grew to              1.4 million in the quarter and total interactive customers now              make up 21% of ADT's customer base. In our residential direct              channel, over 75% of new customers purchased a Pulse system              resulting in approximately 140,000 Pulse customer additions in the              quarter along with upgrades of almost 30,000 existing customers to              Pulse, including selected current 2G customers in-line for              conversion to 3G. Pulse drives higher RPU and delivers a better              customer experience, resulting in stronger retention              characteristics. In particular, Pulse customers choosing              Automation tiers have nearly 40% better attrition on a cumulative              basis after 36 months, and a significantly higher resale rate when              compared to non-Pulse customers.
Enhancing customer experience
New Pulse app: The Company                  released its new Pulse app, enhancing the mobile                  experience for Pulse customers. The new Pulse app, available                  for free through the Apple App Store or Google Play, is an                  intuitive and contemporary experience that makes managing home                  automation and security more effective - especially for                  on-the-go lifestyles. In addition, ADT’s changes to the Pulse                  app reflect the Company's open API strategy for further                  integration with best-in-class third-party solutions, such as                  Nest, and to equip consumers with a smart and secure home                  platform that will evolve to meet their changing needs.
New product integration: ADT                  announced that it has rolled out its integration with Nest                  Labs. The Nest Learning ThermostatTM is now                  supported by ADT Pulse® - the first such commercial                  integration by a North American home security & automation                  provider - and is available now for current ADT customers in                  Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Miami. A nationwide rollout of                  the Nest thermostat is planned by the end of the year.
Improving service levels: The                  Company continued to invest in customer care and service                  personnel in order to reduce the time required for service and                  repair. The average time for repair has improved 30% compared                  to last year.
Quality gross add growth driven by multi channel approach - In-line          with efforts to drive stronger, high-quality gross adds in both the          direct and dealer channels, the Company delivered a 4.8% increase in          gross customer additions over the prior year despite implementing          tenure screening in its direct channel.
Strong telesales and solid close rates helped increase gross adds              in the direct channel by 4% over the prior year. Telesales              increased 12% and self-generated sales increased by 14%. Demand              for ADT Pulse continued to increase, resulting in a 63% take rate              when considering both new and resale Pulse customers in the              residential direct channel.
The dealer channel continued to deliver new customer growth as its              production increased more than 6% year-over-year, driven by higher              production from existing dealers, the inclusion of Protectron's              dealer channel, and new dealers that have joined ADT. Pulse demand              in the dealer channel continued to rise, as evidenced by a 54% Pulse take rate, up from 43% in the same period last year.
Business channel gains traction in small business and making          progress in commercial expansion activities - The Company is          executing on growth initiatives in the small business and commercial          market.
Included in the total Company growth, the small business channel              is driving strong year-over-year organic growth with gross              additions up nearly 14%, while new and resale revenue per user              increased by 5% over last year in the US. Following the expiration              of a prior non-compete agreement, the Company has increased sales              coverage which is contributing to the accelerated growth. Strong              sales of hosted video and a year-over-year increase in Pulse sales              also contributed to this success.
The Company continues to build its commercial presence by adding              to its sales force and expanding its product line and              capabilities. Commercial gross adds increased by 34% and total              revenues increased by 74% from the second quarter, while adding a              strong backlog for the coming period.
Health channel accelerates growth driven by several key initiatives -          The Company implemented several growth initiatives to reposition the          health channel for future success.
ADT's health channel has undergone several changes since the start              of fiscal 2015, including the launch of a health-specific              advertising campaign and the new, on-the-go mobile PERS product,              which is offered through several retailers and ADT.com. Gross additions in the quarter grew nearly 29% and new customer RPU              increased 10% when compared to the same period last year, much of              this driven by the new mPERS product, which made up over one-third              of gross additions after its mid-February launch.
Progress on efforts to serve new non-traditional market segments - ADT          previously announced its alliance with LG Electronics to deliver a new          all-in-one security product and service for the North American "DIY"          market. The new product, scheduled to be launched later this year and          targeted at a market segment outside of ADT's traditional business,          will be manufactured by LG and "secured by ADT."
"The third quarter was further evidence of continued improvement in our        core operations, while strategically positioning ADT for a bright and        profitable future through targeted growth investments," said Michael        Geltzeiler, ADT's chief financial officer. "We are delivering upon the        commitments we outlined earlier in the year and at our recent investor        day meeting, driving increases in gross adds, improving our operating        metrics and investing in growth initiatives in commercial, customer        experience, and the DIY market. Overall, we drove 5% gross add growth        year-over-year, reduced attrition and lowered our direct SAC creation        multiple net of upgrades, while generating higher levels of operating        cash flow. We continue to improve our subscriber acquisition costs,        driving net SAC in our direct channel lower on a sequential basis        despite increased Pulse take rates. EBITDA before special items(1) was nearly flat with last year largely driven by the negative impact of        the marketing efficiency program and increased maintenance and service        costs targeted at improving customer service levels, as well as the        investments we are making in growth initiatives such as commercial, our        DIY offering and the new Pulse mobile app. Pre-SAC EBITDA before special        items(1) grew 3% over last year. Free cash flow before        special items(1)was modestly higher despite a 5% growth in        customer additions. We also continued to invest in what we believe is        the best investment in the security industry, by repurchasing        approximately 1.3 million shares in the quarter."
PROGRESS ON 2015 PRIORITIES: DRIVING COST EFFICIENCIES
Subscriber acquisition cost (SAC) / Creation multiple - Total          net SAC creation multiple, excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, was          30.7x, a year-over-year improvement of 0.3x. Direct net SAC, excluding          the impact of Pulse upgrades, fell below $1,500 to $1,477, and the          creation multiple was 30.7x, an improvement of 0.4x over the same          period last year. The Company reduced net creation multiples by          lowering installation costs and realizing higher RPU generated from          new customers additions.
Total Company operating expenses before special items(3) were up 11.2% over last year driven primarily by the consolidation of          Protectron and the expense recognition from the marketing efficiency          program. Depreciation and amortization ("D&A") before special items(3) expenses rose 9.3% largely related to the consolidation of Protectron,          transitioning a portion of our customer base to Pulse, and the          implementation of certain infrastructure investments to separate from          Tyco and improve our operating efficiency. Excluding Protectron and          the impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating          expenses before special items(3) were up by 5.8% from last          year, as the Company made additional investments in customer          experience, expanding its commercial business and health channel,          rolling out its new Pulse mobile app and developing a new all-in-one          product targeted at the DIY market. Excluding Protectron, D&A before          special items(3)rose by 5.8%.
PROGRESS ON 2015 PRIORITIES: CAPITAL STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION
Share repurchases - The Company repurchased 1.3 million shares          of its common stock at an average price of $35.56 per share during the          third quarter and completed an additional $6 million in share          repurchases subsequent to the end of the quarter. Year-to-date, the          Company has repurchased 5.6 million shares of its common stock at an          average price of $33.53 per share. In July, the Company’s Board of          Directors approved a new incremental share repurchase program          authorizing the Company to purchase $1 billion of its common stock          over the next 3 years, expiring in July 2018. The previous share          repurchase authorization has $192 million remaining and expires on          November 26, 2015.
Debt/Capital Structure - Long-term debt totaled $5.2 billion at          the end of the quarter, maintaining the Company's leverage ratio,          based off of trailing twelve month EBITDA before special items at 2.9x(1) and 2.3x trailing twelve month pre-SAC EBITDA before special          items(1). The Company's average cost of borrowing remained          below 4% in the quarter.
Quarterly dividend - The Company paid a quarterly dividend of          $0.21 per share on May 20th, an increase of 5% versus last year.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
Revenue in constant currency, recurring revenue in constant currency,        leverage ratio, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and        amortization (EBITDA), EBITDA margin, pre-SAC EBITDA, pre-SAC EBITDA        margin, free cash flow (FCF), steady-state free cash flow (SSFCF),        diluted earnings per share (EPS) and diluted EPS at cash tax rates, in        each case "before special items," are non-GAAP measures that may be used        from time to time and should not be considered replacements for GAAP        results.
Revenue and recurring revenue, each in constant currency, are useful        measures because they provide transparency to the underlying performance        in markets outside the United States by excluding the effect that        foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on comparability. Revenue        and recurring revenue in constant currency as presented herein may not        be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The difference between revenue (the most comparable GAAP measure),        revenue in constant currency (non-GAAP measure) and recurring revenue in        constant currency (the non-GAAP measure) is the exclusion of the impact        of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This is also the        primary limitation of this measure, which is best addressed by using        revenue and recurring revenue in constant currency in combination with        GAAP revenue.
The leverage ratio may be presented as the ratio of EBITDA or Pre-SAC        EBITDA before special items to total debt. The leverage ratio is        a useful measure of the Company's credit position and progress towards        leverage targets. Refer to the discussion on EBITDA and Pre-SAC        EBITDA before special items for a description of the differences between        the most comparable GAAP measure. The calculation is limited in        that the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a        dollar-for-dollar basis.
EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's success in acquiring,        retaining and servicing our customer base and ability to generate and        grow recurring revenue while providing a high level of customer service        in a cost-effective manner. The difference between Net Income        (the most comparable GAAP measure) and EBITDA (the non-GAAP measure) is        the exclusion of interest expense, the provision for income taxes,        depreciation and amortization expense. Excluding these items        eliminates the impact of expenses associated with our capitalization and        tax structure as well as the impact of non-cash charges related to        capital investments.
Pre-SAC EBITDA is useful because it measures the Company's        operational profits from its existing customer base by excluding certain        revenue and expenses related to acquiring new customers. The        difference between Net Income (the most comparable GAAP measure) and        pre-SAC EBITDA (the non-GAAP measure) is the exclusion of interest        expense, the provision for income taxes, depreciation expense,        amortization expense, gross subscriber acquisition cost expenses and        revenue associated with the sale of equipment. Excluding these        items eliminates the impact of expenses associated with our        capitalization and tax structure, the impact of non-cash charges related        to capital investments and the impact of growing our subscriber base.
In addition, from time to time, the Company may present EBITDA and        pre-SAC EBITDA before special items, which are the respective measures,        adjusted to exclude the impact of the special items highlighted below. These numbers provide information to investors regarding the impact        of certain items management believes are useful to identify, as        described below. EBITDA and pre-SAC EBITDA may also be presented        at constant currency. Constant currency presentation is useful        because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in        markets outside the U.S. by excluding the effect that foreign currency        exchange rate fluctuations have on comparability.
There are material limitations to using EBITDA and pre-SAC EBITDA. EBITDA and pre-SAC EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled        measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and        pre-SAC EBITDA do not take into account certain significant items,        including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and tax        expense, which directly affect our net income. Additionally,        pre-SAC EBITDA does not take into account expenses related to acquiring        new customers. When presented at constant currency, these        measures exclude of the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic        effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering EBITDA        and pre-SAC EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in        accordance with GAAP. The EBITDA and pre-SAC EBITDA discussion        above is also applicable to the respective margin measures.
FCF is a useful measure of the Company's ability to repay debt, make        other investments and return capital to shareholders through dividends        and share repurchases. The difference between Cash Flows from        Operating Activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the        non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact of capital expenditures,        subscriber system assets, dealer generated customer accounts and bulk        account purchases. Dealer generated accounts are accounts that        are generated through the network of authorized dealers. Bulk        account purchases represent accounts acquired from third parties outside        of the authorized dealer network, such as other security service        providers, on a selective basis. These items are subtracted from        cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term        investments that are required for normal business activities.
SSFCF is a useful measure of pre-levered cash that is generated by        the Company after the cost of replacing recurring revenue lost to        attrition, but before the cost of new subscribers that drive recurring        revenue growth. The difference between Net Income (the most        comparable GAAP measure) and SSFCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists of        the factors discussed above regarding pre-SAC EBITDA, on a        quarter-to-date basis. Pre-SAC EBITDA is then annualized and        adjusted for additional factors, described in the reconciliation below,        required to maintain the steady-state. Certain components of        these inputs are determined using trailing twelve month information or        information from the most recent quarter.
In addition, from time to time the Company may present FCF and SSFCF        before special items, which is FCF or SSFCF, adjusted to exclude the        impact of the special items highlighted below. These numbers        provide information to investors regarding the impact of certain items        management believes are useful to identify, as described below.
The limitation associated with using FCF and SSFCF is that they        adjust for certain items that are ultimately within management's and the        Board of Directors' discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that        there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable        GAAP measure. FCF is not intended to represent residual cash flow        for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and        other non-discretionary expenditures are not reduced. This        limitation is best addressed by using FCF and SSFCF in combination with        other GAAP financial measures.
FCF and SSFCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly        titled measures reported by other companies. These measures        should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors        are urged to read the Company's financial statements as filed with the        Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables        to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measure.
Diluted EPS at cash tax rates is a useful measure of the Company's        diluted earnings per share after considering the difference between the        effective tax rate and cash tax rate. The difference between        diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measure) and diluted EPS at cash        tax rates (the non-GAAP measure) is the exclusion of the impact of        income tax expense and the inclusion of the impact of income taxes paid,        net of refunds. Adjusting for these items provides information on        the impact of our net operating loss carryforwards on our diluted EPS.
The Company has presented its diluted EPS, diluted EPS at cash tax        rates, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, pre-SAC EBITDA, pre-SAC EBITDA margin,        FCF, SSFCF and other measures before special items. Special items        include charges and gains related to acquisitions, restructurings,        impairments, and other income or charges that may mask the underlying        operating results and/or business trends of the Company. The        Company utilizes these measures to assess overall operating performance,        as well as to provide insight to management in evaluating overall        operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. The        Company may also present its effective tax rate as adjusted for special        items for consistency. One or more of these measures may be used        as components in the Company's incentive compensation plans. These        measures are useful for investors because they may permit more        meaningful comparisons of the Company's underlying operating results and        business trends between periods. The difference between net        income and diluted EPS before special items and net income and diluted        EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the        special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. EBITDA,        EBITDA margin, pre-SAC EBITDA and pre-SAC EBITDA margin before special        items do not reflect any additional adjustments, other than taxes, that        are not reflected in net income before special items. The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may        be material) of items that increase or decrease the Company's reported        operating income, operating margin, net income and EPS. This        limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in        combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better        understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease        on reported results.
The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our        non-GAAP outlook to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP        measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP outlook, other than those        described above, are difficult to predict and are primarily dependent on        future uncertainties. The GAAP measures excluded from our        non-GAAP outlook for which we do not prepare a reconcilable GAAP        forecast include the factors described above for recurring revenue,        pre-SAC EBITDA before special items, SSFCF before special items, and in        each case at constant currency.

If one or more of these risks or        uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be        incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Consequently, actual events and results may vary significantly from        those included in or contemplated or implied by our forward-looking        statements. More detailed information about these and other        factors is set forth in ADT's most recent annual report on Form 10-K,        our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other subsequent filings with        the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
