DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Chipotle Mexican Grill ( CMG ) will host a national employee meeting       on February 8, to thank employees for their extraordinary work       implementing Chipotle’s comprehensive new food safety programs in their       restaurants, as well as outlining for all employees the steps that have       been taken outside the restaurants to make Chipotle ingredients safer       than ever. The company will also share information as to what may have       caused some customers to become ill in 2015.
“Over the last few months, we have been implementing an enhanced food       safety plan that will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food       safety,” said Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle.       “Most of the new protocols are already in place, thanks to the hard work       and dedication our excellent restaurant teams. Additionally, we have       implemented unprecedented food safety standards with our suppliers,       which make the food coming into our restaurants safer than ever before.”
Chipotle’s enhanced food safety program is the product of a       comprehensive reassessment of its food safety practices conducted with       industry leading experts that included a farm-to-fork assessment of each       ingredient Chipotle uses with an eye toward establishing the highest       standards for safety. The program’s many components include:
High-resolution DNA-based testing of many ingredients designed to         ensure the quality and safety of ingredients before they are shipped         to restaurants -- a testing program that far exceeds requirements of         state and federal regulatory agencies, as well as industry standards.
Changes to food prep and food handling practices, including washing         and cutting of some produce items (such as tomatoes and romaine         lettuce) and shredding cheese in central kitchens, blanching of some         produce items (including avocados, onions and limes) in its         restaurants, and new protocols for marinating chicken and steak.
Enhanced internal training to ensure that all employees thoroughly         understand the company’s high standards for food safety and food         handling.
Paid sick leave helping to ensure that ill employees have no incentive         to work while ill.
The meeting will be broadcast live from Denver to hundreds of locations across the country. In order to allow all employees to attend, the       company will be closing its restaurants for lunch that day. The       restaurants will reopen nationally at 3:00 PM.
“Chipotle is an established leader in our use of high quality       ingredients – ingredients like Responsibly Raised™ meats, local and       organically grown produce and pasture-raised dairy – and preparing our       food using classic cooking techniques,” said Ells. “Now, we are working       to establish the company as the leader in food safety as well. Our       employees will play a critical role in helping us achieve this goal and       we want them to know how much we appreciate their dedication to this       critical mission.”
ABOUT CHIPOTLE
Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea       that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience.       Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos,       burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from       fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking       methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of       Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using       ingredients that are not only fresh, but that—where possible—are       sustainably grown and raised responsibly with respect for the animals,       the land, and the farmers who produce the food. In order to achieve this       vision, we focus on building a special people culture that is centered       on creating teams of top performers empowered to achieve high standards.       This people culture not only leads to a better dining experience for our       customers, it also allows us to develop future leaders from within.       Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in 1993 and operates more than       1,900 restaurants, including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the US, 11       ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, and is an investor in an       entity that owns and operates three Pizzeria Locale restaurants.
