PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
NRG Yield, Inc. (NYSE:NYLD, NYLD.A) today reported second quarter 2015        financial results including Adjusted EBITDA of $187 million and CAFD of        $26 million. Net income attributable to Class A and Class C stockholders        for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $10 million or $0.15 per        Class A and Class C common share.
“NRG Yield continues to be one of the most prudently robust and diverse        yieldcos in the market, allowing us to continue to transform the energy        industry at an accelerated pace,” said David Crane, Chairman and CEO of        NRG Yield. “While the industry as a whole underperformed this quarter,        as a result of historically low wind resource, NRG Yield’s diversified        asset portfolio provides lower potential volatility, enabling us to        reaffirm both our current dividend and our anticipated trajectory of        dividend growth going forward.”
Overview of Financial and Operating Results
Note 1: In accordance with GAAP, 2014 results have been recast        to include the Drop Down Assets transferred to NRG Yield by NRG on June        30, 2014 and January 2, 2015 as if the combination has been in effect        since the inception of common control.

For quarter ended June 30, 2015, NRG Yield reported Net Income of $41        million, Adjusted EBITDA of $187 million, and CAFD of $26 million.        Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was higher than the same period in 2014        by $46 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Alta Wind        portfolio in the third quarter 2014. Second quarter CAFD was $17 million        lower than the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of the timing        of the Alta Wind debt service and additional corporate interest.

For second quarter 2015, NRG Yield maintained strong safety performance        with a 0.97 incident rate. Generation in the renewable segment was 110%        higher in the second quarter versus the same period in 2014 as a result        of the Alta acquisition. Although overall renewable generation was        substantially higher from the addition of assets, our wind assets        continue to experience historically low wind resource leading to a        downward adjustment to expected wind production over the balance of the        year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
$
863
Total liquidity as of June 30, 2015 was $515 million, a decrease of $348        million from December 31, 2014. This reflects a decrease in revolver        availability of $216 million and a decrease in cash of $132 million        primarily used to fund drop down acquisitions from NRG.1
Distributed Generation Partnership
On May 8, 2015, NRG and NRG Yield completed the formation of a new        partnership that will invest in and hold operating portfolios of        distributed solar assets developed by NRG Renew, a subsidiary of NRG.        Under the terms of the partnership agreement, NRG Yield will receive 95% of the portfolio economics until achieving a targeted return after which        NRG will receive 95% of the economics.
NRG Yield has initially committed to invest up to $100 million of cash        equity into the partnership, of which approximately $4 million has been        invested to date. The partnership is expected to be fully funded within        18 months from formation.
Completed Acquisition of 25% Interest in Desert Sunlight
On June 29, 2015, NRG Yield acquired a 25 percent interest in the Desert        Sunlight Solar Farm in Riverside, CA from GE for $285 million, subject        to working capital adjustments, plus the assumption of $287 million of        non-recourse project level debt2.
The acquisition, which results in an increase of 137.5 MW of operating        solar capacity owned by NRG Yield, places the Company into a partnership        with subsidiaries of NextEra Energy and Sumitomo Financial, who are the        50 percent and 25 percent owners of Desert Sunlight, respectively. The        transaction is expected to contribute Adjusted EBITDA of $45 million and        CAFD of $22 million on an annual run rate basis.
Completed Tax Equity Financing of Alta X and Alta XI Wind Facilities
On June 30, 2015, NRG Yield closed a new tax equity facility primarily        to monetize production tax credits from the Alta Wind X and XI wind        projects. This financing resulted in $119 million of cash proceeds after        expenses. Proceeds from this transaction and a portion of the proceeds        from the recently completed equity and debt offerings were utilized to        repay the entire outstanding project indebtedness associated with Alta X        and Alta XI wind facilities resulting in an increase in annual run rate        CAFD of $28 million.
Completed Class C Common Stock Offering and Convertible Debt Issuance
On June 29, 2015, NRG Yield issued 28,198,000 shares of Class C common        stock at $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $600 million.        Additionally, NRG Yield issued $287.5 million of 3.25% convertible        senior notes due 2020. The net proceeds of both of these issuances were        used for the acquisition of a 25% interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar        Farm for $285 million3, to repay a portion of the $491        million in debt associated with the Alta X and Alta XI wind facilities        (in order to facilitate the tax equity financing transaction described        above), and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under NRG        Yield’s revolving credit facility.
Drop-Down of Assets from NRG
NRG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in an 814        net MW portfolio of twelve wind projects consisting of assets acquired        by NRG in the EME transaction and part of the expanded ROFO agreement.        The portfolio is subject to a tax equity arrangement. The acquisition,        subject to approval by NRG Yield’s independent directors, is expected to        generate approximately $35 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA and $20        million of annual CAFD on a run rate basis4. The wind assets        included in the portfolio are:
Elkhorn Ridge – 54 MW wind facility located in Bloomfield, NE
San Juan Mesa – 90 MW wind facility located in Elida, NM
Wildorado – 161 MW wind facility located in Vega, TX
Crosswinds – 21 MW wind facility located in Ayrshire, IA
Forward – 29 MW wind facility located in Berlin, PA
Hardin – 15 MW wind facility located in Jefferson, IA
Odin – 20 MW wind facility located in Odin, MN
Sleeping Bear – 95 MW wind facility located in Woodward, OK
Spanish Fork – 19 MW wind facility located in Spanish Fork, UT
Lookout – 38 MW wind facility located in Berlin, PA
Goat Wind – 150 MW wind facility located in Sterling City, TX
Elbow Creek – 122 MW wind facility located in Howard County, TX
Quarterly Dividend Updates
On May 20, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly        dividend on each of the Company’s Class A and Class C common stock of        $0.20 per share ($0.80 per share annualized) paid on June 15, 2015 to        shareholders of record as of June 1, 2015. This equates to a 2.6%        increase over the prior quarter.
On August 4, 2015, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly        dividend on Class A and Class C common stock of $0.21 per share ($0.84        per share annualized) payable on September 15, 2015 to shareholders of        record as of September 1, 2015. This equates to a 5% increase over the        prior quarter and a 15% increase year over year.
The Company's common stock dividend is subject to available capital,        market conditions and compliance with associated laws and regulations.
Seasonality
NRG Yield’s quarterly operating results and CAFD are significantly        impacted by seasonal factors. The majority of NRG Yield’s revenues are        generated from the months of May through September, as contracted        pricing and renewable resources are at their highest levels in the        Company’s core markets. The factors driving the fluctuation in Adjusted        EBITDA and CAFD include the following:
Higher summer capacity prices from conventional assets
Higher solar intensity during the summer months; and
Debt service payments which are disbursed either quarterly or          semi-annually, thereby allowing distributions to be allowed from the          projects with non-recourse debt
The Company has taken into consideration the timing of such revenues and        costs to ensure sufficient funds are available for distribution on a        quarterly basis.
Financial Guidance
Due to the continued unusually low wind production across the fleet, the        Company has revised its expectations for wind production over the        balance of 2015. As a result of these reduced expectations, combined        with a lower expected pace of deployments of residential solar leases        from NRG, NRG Yield is updating full year guidance for Adjusted EBITDA        to $660 million and CAFD to $160 million. The Company does not expect        the reduction in 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD guidance to have any        impact on either its current dividend or expected long-term dividend        growth.
Without any effect to future acquisitions or drop downs, the Company        expects the current portfolio to generate $760 million of Adjusted        EBITDA and $245 million of CAFD on an annual run rate basis. Based on        these updated annual run-rate projections, the Company is also targeting        a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share ($1.00 per share annualized) on        each of the Company’s Class A and Class C common stock by the 4th quarter of 2016. This represents a 19% increase over the current        annualized dividend rate and 67% increase since NRG Yield’s first        dividend in the fourth quarter of 2013.
For third quarter 2015, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA of $195        million and CAFD of $110 million, although actual results may vary        depending on the operating performance of the assets.
