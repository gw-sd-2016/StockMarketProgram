DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
AGCO Corporation ( AGCO ) announced today that it will launch       a new solution for wireless task data transfer. Go-Task™ will       be one of AGCO’s solutions for wireless transfer of task data to and       from select AGCO machines and supported Farm Management Information       Software (FMIS) programs.
The Go-Task mobile app will be a key product of Fuse® Technologies, AGCO’s next generation approach to precision agriculture       and precision machine management. Go-Task will enable farmers to make       better decisions by reducing the time and effort it takes to move and       manage the task data generated and utilized by their operation.
Features and Benefits of The Go-Task app Include:
Enables wireless task data transfer between your AGCO machine and a         supported FMIS
Eliminates risk of lost or incomplete task data that may result             from lost USB sticks or other complications associated with manual             data transfer
Easier movement and management of data, enabling better             operational decisions leading to increased efficiency and             productivity
Go-Task utilizes AGCO’s existing task data exchange server for task         data transfer
Task data is sent via AGCO’s task data exchange server directly             into your supported FMIS software. This ensures that you have             complete control over who can see your data.
AGCO’s task data exchange server is currently connected with             multiple FMIS programs. As part of AGCO’s open approach, the             number of FMIS programs connected to the server will continue to             grow
Go-Task can be used on your iOS 7.0 and above devices including iPod,         iPhone and iPad
Transfer files using existing data plan
Configure app to use only Wi-Fi networks reducing data plan usage
Wi-Fi only mode can be used on devices that do not have a cellular             connection
Go-Task automatically syncs with task data on the terminal when a task         is completed or paused
Reduces risk of lost or missing task data in an FMIS that may             result from an operator failing to download data after a job is             completed.
AGCO’s Go-Task mobile app can be used on any machine utilizing a C1000,       C2100, or C3000 terminal for logging task data (using supported software       version). All you will need is a supported wireless USB dongle, a       subscription to AGCO’s task data exchange server, and the Go-Task app       which will be downloadable for free from the iTunes app store. Pricing       and other information concerning subscription and hardware requirements       will be made available by January 2016 with the official market release       of the Go-Task app.
“The new Go-Task Mobile app will provide farmers with a greater level of       connectivity within their operation by enabling them to more seamlessly       move and manage the task data that is used and produced by their       operations,” said Carla Gasparin, Manager, Product Management, Global       Off-board Technologies at AGCO. “AGCO’s goal for our customers with       regards to their task data is to make it as easy as possible for the       customer to move their data to and from their machines, FMIS programs,       or preferred service providers.”
