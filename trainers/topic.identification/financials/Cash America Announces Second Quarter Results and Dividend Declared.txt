FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Cash America International, Inc. ( CSH ) announced today that net        income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was        $2,071,000 (8 cents per share) compared to a net loss from continuing        operations of $11,746,000 (loss of 41 cents per share) for the second        quarter of 2014. After adjusting for non-operating items in both the        current and the prior year second quarter, adjusted net income from        continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $1,761,000 (6 cents per        share) for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a net loss of        $2,050,000 (loss of 8 cents per share) for the second quarter of 2014.
Included in the reported net income from continuing operations for the        second quarter of 2015 is a gain on the disposition of equity securities        of $1.1 million before taxes (3 cents per share after taxes) and a loss        on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million before taxes (1 cent        per share after taxes), which in aggregate increased income by $0.5        million before taxes (2 cents per share after taxes). When excluding        this additional income, adjusted net income from continuing operations,        a non-GAAP measure, was $1.8 million (6 cents per share) for the second        quarter of 2015, which exceeded the high end of the Company’s published        guidance of expected net income per share from continuing operations of        between 1 cent and 5 cents per share provided in its press release dated        April 30, 2015. Included in the results for the second quarter of 2014        was a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a loss related to a        litigation settlement, which in aggregate reduced net income by $15.4        million before taxes (33 cents per share after taxes). Excluding these        expenses, adjusted net loss from continuing operations, a non-GAAP        measure, would have been $2.1 million, representing a loss of 8 cents        per share, in the second quarter of 2014.
Consolidated total revenue was $236.5 million for the second quarter of        2015 compared to $253.6 million for the second quarter of 2014.        Consolidated net revenue was $134.0 million for the second quarter of        2015, compared to $141.2 million for the second quarter of 2014.        Included in the second quarter of 2014 were the results of the Company’s        Mexico-based pawn business, which was sold in the third quarter of 2014.        The Company’s net revenue from domestic operations was $134.0 million        for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $138.1 million for the second        quarter of 2014, with the $4.1 million decrease primarily due to lower        pawn loan fees and service charges as a result of lower average pawn        loan balances, as well as decreased consumer loan net revenue as a        result of the Company's strategic decision to de-emphasize and eliminate        its unsecured short-term consumer loan activities in many of its        locations. Consumer loan fees represented only 8% of the Company’s        consolidated total revenue for the second quarter of 2015.
While net revenue from the Company’s domestic operations was 3% below        the prior year’s second quarter results, the domestic business produced        a 58% increase in income from operations, which reached $6.4 million for        the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $4.0 million for the        three months ended June 30, 2014. Commenting on the second quarter        results, Daniel R. Feehan, Chief Executive Officer of Cash America,        said, “The first half of 2015 has shaped up much as we expected as our        efforts to emphasize improved marginal profitability through expense        management allowed us to report a significant increase in earnings        compared to the prior year. As we enter the second half of 2015, we are        well positioned to leverage our focus on business fundamentals and        execution to expand net revenue and continue to report year-over-year        increases in earnings and marginal profitability.”
The Company announced a four million share repurchase authorization on        January 29, 2015. As a part of that authorization, the Company        repurchased 1,184,230 shares during the second quarter of 2015. In        aggregate, these shares were purchased at an approximate average price        of $26.77 per share and represented approximately 4% of the fully        diluted shares as of the end of the first quarter of 2015. Through the        six-month period ended June 30, 2015, the Company has purchased        2,332,230 shares under this repurchase authorization at an average price        of approximately $24.44 per share, representing approximately 8% of the        fully diluted shares as of the end of December 31, 2014. The Company        ended the second quarter with $44 million in cash and no borrowings        outstanding under its $280 million line of credit.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company reported net income        from continuing operations of $9.9 million (35 cents per share) compared        to a net loss of $8.5 million (a loss of 30 cents per share) for the        same period in 2014. Included in the reported net income for the six        months ended June 30, 2015 is a gain on the disposition of equity        securities, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and severance        expenses related to administrative and operations staff reductions,        which in aggregate reduced net income from continuing operations by $0.2        million before taxes (1 cent per share after taxes). When excluding        these items, adjusted net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP        measure, was $10.1 million (36 cents per share) for the six months ended        June 30, 2015. This compares to adjusted net income from continuing        operations, a non-GAAP measure, of $2.3 million (7 cents per share) for        the six-months ended June 30, 2014, which adds back to the reported        results the expense for the early extinguishment of debt of $10.4        million after taxes and litigation settlement expenses of $0.4 million        after taxes, for a total of $10.8 million (37 cents per share) for the        six months ended June 30, 2014.
Consolidated total revenue was $508.2 million for the six months ended        June 30, 2015 compared to $538.2 million for the same period in 2014,        which included the Company’s Mexico-based pawn lending business in 2014.        The Company’s domestic business posted total revenue of $508.2 million        compared to $525.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and        2014, respectively. Consistent with the second quarter of 2015, the        domestic business produced an increase in operating income while        overcoming lower total and net revenue. The Company’s domestic        operations generated a 21% increase in income from operations, which        reached $22.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to        $18.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014.

Outlook for the Third Quarter of 2015 and the        2015 Fiscal Year
Management believes that the opportunities for growth in revenue and        earnings will be largely associated with customer demand for the credit        products provided by the Company, which predominantly take the form of        pawn loans, the disposition of unredeemed collateral by way of consumer        spending on retail sales, the commercial sale of refined gold and        diamonds and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. During the second        quarter, pawn loan balances increased sequentially from the first        quarter in-line with traditional seasonal growth. Management expects        traditional sequential pawn loan balance growth in the third quarter and        believes that the rate and timing of this growth will have a significant        influence on the third and fourth quarter results.
Based on its views on the preceding factors, management expects net        income per share for the third quarter of 2015 to be between 17 cents        and 20 cents per share compared to a net loss from continuing operations        of 32 cents per share in the third quarter of 2014. During the third        quarter of 2014, management implemented actions that generated $14.1        million in after-tax expenses (48 cents per share) related to the sale        of non-strategic operations in Mexico and Colorado, the early        extinguishment of long-term debt and a corporate reorganization to        create expense efficiencies. Excluding the $14.1 million in expenses        related to these items incurred in the third quarter of 2014, adjusted        net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, would have        been $4.7 million (16 cents per share) for the third quarter of 2014.
At this time, management modifies and increases its previously reported        expectations for its fiscal year 2015 adjusted EBITDA to an anticipated        range of between $117 million to $125 million, which management        estimates will generate between $0.95 and $1.10 in adjusted net income        per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes        the disposition of equity securities, a loss on early extinguishment of        debt and severance expenses related to administrative and operations        staff reductions, which in aggregate reduced income for the six months        ended June 30, 2015 by 1 cent per share. This compares to a reported net        loss from continuing operations of 36 cents per share for fiscal year        2014, which included expense items totaling 87 cents per share related        to the early extinguishment of debt, a loss on divestitures and the        severance expenses related to administrative and operations staff        reductions. Adding back the expense per share of 87 cents incurred        during 2014, adjusted net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP        measure, for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have been 51 cents        per share.
