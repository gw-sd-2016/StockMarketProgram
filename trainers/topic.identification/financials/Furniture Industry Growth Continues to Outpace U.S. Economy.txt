NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Growth in the U.S. furniture industry continues to outpace the U.S.       economy, due in large part to strong performances in bedroom and dining       room furnishing sales. While housing continues to improve and       discretionary spending increases, the sector should continue to improve       through the remainder of the year and into 2016. These are some of the       observations from Mike       Hudgens , Southeast Regional Manager of  CIT       Commercial Services , a leading provider of factoring services and a       division of CIT       Group Inc. ( CIT ), in “Furniture       Industry Outlook: Growth in Sector Continues to Outpace U.S. Economy ,”       ( http://www.cit.com/hudgens ),       the latest piece of market intelligence in a series of in-depth CIT       executive Q&As.
“While the U.S. economy has remained relatively flat, the U.S. furniture       markets have seen an uptick due in large part to new home sales and an       increase in consumer spending as they look to furnish homes,” said       Hudgens. “As a result, we expect the sector to continue to improve the       remainder of this year and anticipate another active year in 2016       particularly in the bedroom and dining room sectors.”
Some of the other trends Hudgens expands upon include:
China’s Currency Woes Could Positively Impact the Furniture Trade: China’s         recent woes may have a positive effect on the furniture sector. Some         furniture manufacturing has moved to other Asian countries, such as         Indonesia and Vietnam, which has the potential to lower the cost for         buyers – a potential benefit to U.S. consumers and U.S. importers.
A Significant Interest Rate Hike Could Have a Negative Impact: The         biggest fear is that interest rate hikes could slow down the housing         market. The furniture sector has greatly benefitted from the pick-up         in housing, so a significant and sustained slowdown there could be         devastating to the industry.
West Coast Port Shutdown Benefitted Sector: The lingering         effect from the port shutdown earlier this year has forced companies         to plan better for future disruptions. Companies are spending more on         logistics to ensure they can take delivery of products sooner and are         developing alternative shipping plans.
Onshoring Is Losing Steam: The conversation regarding onshoring         has changed over the last year. With a decline in fuel prices, the         cost to ship goods overseas and labor costs, many companies are now         reconsidering the benefits of onshoring. Many believe onshoring, the         “Made in America” movement, may be slowing down.
