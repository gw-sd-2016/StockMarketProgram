Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in        accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting        principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other        companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any        comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule E of this press release provides the reconciliation of the        Company’s historical non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating        performance from continuing operations against past periods and to        budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures        also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and        trends across different reporting periods on a consistent        basis. Management also believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP        items is useful to investors because it provides investors with the        operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables        investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP revenue:
Hittite Operations: The results of operation of Hittite from July        22, 2014 through August 2, 2014 have been excluded from our non-GAAP        measures because they are not reflective of ongoing operating results.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP gross margin,        non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP        operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
Hittite Operations: The results of operation of Hittite from July        22, 2014 through August 2, 2014 have been excluded from our non-GAAP        measures because they are not reflective of ongoing operating results.
Acquisition-Related Expenses: Expenses incurred in the second and        third quarters of fiscal 2015 and the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as a        result of the Hittite acquisition primarily include: severance payments,        expense associated with the fair value adjustments to inventory and        property, plant and equipment; and amortization of acquisition related        intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased        technology and customer relationships. We excluded these costs from our        non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are        not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating        expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and        non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs: Costs incurred as a result        of the Hittite acquisition in the second and third quarters of fiscal        2015 and the third quarter of fiscal 2014 include professional fees and        settlement costs directly related to the Hittite acquisition. We        excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a        specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial        performance.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP other expense and        non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
Acquisition-Related Debt Costs: The Company incurred debt        financing costs and interest expense during the third quarter of fiscal        2014 on its 90-day term loan facility used to finance the Hittite        acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because        they are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per        share:
Tax-Related Items: In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the        Company recorded $0.7 million of tax adjustments associated with the        Hittite acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs. In the        second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company recorded $1.5 million of tax        adjustments associated with the Hittite acquisition-related expenses and        transaction costs. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP        measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our        current operating results.
Analog Devices believes that these non-GAAP measures have material        limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated        with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and        that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of        operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In        addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP        measures reported by other companies. The Company’s use of non-GAAP        measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items,        is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may        be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record        such items in future periods.
Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction        with the corresponding GAAP measures.
