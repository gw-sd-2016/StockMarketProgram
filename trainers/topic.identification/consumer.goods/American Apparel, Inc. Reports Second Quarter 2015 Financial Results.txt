LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
American Apparel, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT: APP), a        vertically-integrated manufacturer, distributor, and retailer of branded        fashion basic apparel, announced financial results for its second        quarter ended June 30, 2015.
Summary
Announced the next phase of its strategic turnaround plan including          approximately $30 million in cost-cutting initiatives over the next 18          months.
Strengthened the leadership team with hiring of General Manager of          Global Retail and President of Wholesale to help execute its global          retail and wholesale turnaround strategies.
Loss per share in the second quarter 2015 was $0.11 and included $0.05          of significant charges
Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2015 was $4.1 million
Operating expenses in the second quarter 2015 decreased $8.2 million,          or 10.2%, compared to the same period in 2014
Inventories in the second quarter 2015 decreased $32.6 million, or          22.1%, compared to December 31, 2014.
Operating Results - Second Quarter 2015
Net sales for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 17.2% to $134.4        million from $162.4 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding the        year over year impact from foreign exchange and stores closed in 2014,        net sales decreased 14% from the same period in 2014. The decline in        comparable sales was attributable to the lack of new style introduction        for the spring and summer selling season. Net sales also decreased        approximately $3 million due to the store closures. In addition, the        unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes contributed        to the sales decrease of approximately 4% or $6.2 million.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 25.3% to $61.5        million from $82.4 million for the same period in 2014. Gross margin for        the second quarter of 2015 was 45.8% compared to 50.7% for the same        period in 2014. The decrease was primarily related to lower retail sales        coupled with the negative effects of foreign currency exchange rate        changes and an increase in workers compensation and health benefit costs.
Operating expense for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 10.2% to        $71.4 million from $79.6 million for the same period in 2014 due        primarily to lower payroll and reduced shipping, rent, supplies and        miscellaneous activities, all primarily as a result of our cost        reduction efforts. Excluding the effects of the significant charges        described below, operating expenses decreased 12.8% to $65.1 million        from the same period in 2014.
Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $19.4 million or $0.11 per        share, compared to net loss of $16.2 million, or $0.09 per share for the        second quarter of 2014. Results for the second quarter of 2015 include        $8.3 million, or $0.05 per share, related to significant charges.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Under the $10 million "at-the-market" offering program, we may, from        time to time and at our discretion, offer and sell shares of our common        stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $10 million (but in        no event more than 15 million shares). We have used the net proceeds        generated through the program for working capital and general corporate        purposes. As of June 30, 2015, we had issued 4 million shares of our        common stock for net proceeds of $2.0 million. Sales of common stock        under the "at-the-market" offering program are at our sole discretion        and subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement related        thereto, and there are no assurances that such sales will continue in        the future.
As of June 30, 2015, we had $6.9 million in cash, $38.4 million        outstanding on our $50.0 million asset-backed revolving credit facility        with Capital One and $6.1 million of availability for additional        borrowings as of such date. On August 11, 2015, we had $11.2 million in        cash. As of June 30, 2015, we had $210.6 million aggregate principal        amount of senior secured notes (the "Notes") outstanding. On April 14,        2015, we paid $13.8 million in interest on the Notes. The next scheduled        interest payment on the Notes due on October 15, 2015 is approximately        $13.9 million.
As of June 30, 2015, we were not in compliance with the minimum fixed        charge coverage ratio and the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenants under        the Capital One Credit Facility. For the April 1, 2015 through June 30,        2015 covenant reference period, our fixed charge coverage ratio (as        defined in the Capital One Credit Facility) was 0.07 to 1.00 as compared        with the covenant minimum of 0.33 to 1.00, and our adjusted EBITDA (as        defined in the Capital One Credit Facility) was $4.1 million as compared        with the covenant minimum of $7.4 million.
On August 17, 2015, Capital One assigned its rights and obligations as a        lender to a syndicate of lenders that includes certain of our existing        creditors, including funds associated with Standard General L.P.,        Monarch Alternative Capital L.P., Coliseum Capital LLC and Goldman Sachs        Asset Management, L.P., and was replaced by Wilmington Trust, National        Association ("Wilmington Trust") as administrative agent. Additionally,        on August 17, the Capital One Credit Facility was amended pursuant to an        amended and restated credit agreement among us, the new syndicate of        lenders and Wilmington Trust (the "Wilmington Trust Credit Facility").        In connection with such amendment, the syndicate of lenders received        certain amendment and closing fees and reimbursement of closing        expenses. The covenant violations existing at June 30, 2015 were waived        under the Wilmington Trust Credit Facility.
The Wilmington Trust Credit Facility provides for a $90 million        asset-based revolving credit facility and matures on April 4, 2018,        subject to a January 15, 2018 maturity in limited circumstances.        Borrowings under the Wilmington Trust Credit Facility are subject to        specified borrowing base requirements which is increased by $15 million,        but such $15 million increase cannot increase the borrowing base above        $60 million. Amounts repaid under the Wilmington Trust Credit Facility        cannot be re-borrowed.
Borrowings currently outstanding under the Capital One Credit Facility        will continue under the Wilmington Trust Credit Facility and bear        interest at a LIBOR based rate plus 5.00% or a rate based on the prime        rate plus 4.00%. New borrowings under the Wilmington Trust Credit        Facility bear interest at a LIBOR based rate plus 7.00% or a rate based        on the prime rate plus 6.00%.
Additionally, on August 17, 2015, we entered into amendments to the        indenture agreement governing the Senior Notes and the Standard General        Loan Agreement to permit us to enter into the Wilmington Trust Credit        Facility.
We incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows from        operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and such        losses might continue for the remainder of 2015. Based upon the trends        occurring in our operations since June 30, 2015 and through the date of        this release, together with our current expectations and projections for        the next four fiscal quarters, we believe that we may not have        sufficient liquidity necessary to sustain operations for the next twelve        months. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we may        be able to continue as a going concern.
As a result of the Capital One Credit Facility covenant default and the        liquidity uncertainty described above, we have been working with our        advisers and have begun discussions with certain key financial        stakeholders to analyze potential strategic and financial alternatives,        which may include, among other things, refinancing or new capital        raising transactions, amendments to or restructuring of our existing        indebtedness and other obligations, and consideration of other        restructuring and recapitalization transactions. As of the date of this        release, substantial uncertainty exists as to the ultimate outcome of        those discussions, and there are no assurances that such efforts will        result in any transaction or agreement, or that any such transaction or        agreement, if proposed and/or implemented, will be successful. In        addition, whether or not any such transactions or agreements were        implemented or successful, our existing and any new investors could        suffer substantial or total losses of their investment in our common        stock.
Unrealized Gain/Loss on Change in Fair Value of Warrants
As of June 30, 2015, Lion Capital LLP held warrants to purchase 24.5        million shares of our common stock. As a result of the "at-the-market"        offering program, Lion received the right to purchase an additional        12,000 shares of our common stock with an adjusted exercise price of all        of the Lion-held warrants at $0.66.
As the share price of our stock increases, the fair value of warrant        liability recorded on the balance sheet increases, and we record an        expense to recognize the increase in fair value of the warrant        liability. Conversely, when the share price of our stock decreases, we        record a gain to recognize the related reduction in the fair value of        the warrant liability on the balance sheets. Although the income        statement impacts associated with warrants are appropriate and required        under GAAP, they do not impact our operating performance nor do the        credits and charges have an impact on the cash balances since the        liability recorded is not an obligation that will be settled with cash.        Instead, these warrants will be reclassified to equity when they are        exercised.
EBITDA add backs
Sale of slow-moving inventory program discounts - In the first        quarter management implemented an initiative to accelerate the sale of        slow moving inventory with a graduated sales discount program through        our retail and online sales channels, as well as through certain        off-price channels. The program resulted in a significant reduction of        slow moving inventory. This program is a part of management’s strategic        shift to change the profile of our inventory and actively reduce        inventory levels to improve store merchandising, working capital and        liquidity. There was minimal activity related to this program in the        second quarter.
Customs settlements and contingencies - As previously disclosed,        we have been subject to, and have recorded charges related to, customs        and similar audit settlements and contingencies in certain jurisdictions.
Litigation and professional fees - We incurred additional legal,        litigation and consulting costs related to various claims and lawsuits        and the sale of the slow moving inventory in the first quarter.
Employment settlements and severance - We had previously        disclosed employment-related claims and experienced unusually high        employee severance costs during 2014 and 2015.
Lease amendment - On July 27, 2015, we entered into a second        amendment to the lease agreement for our headquarters and manufacturing        facility in Los Angeles, California, resolving certain alleged breaches        from early 2014 under the lease agreement with the landlord.
Definitions and Disclosures Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company reports and discusses its operating results using financial        measures consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)        and believes that this should be the primary basis for evaluating the        Company's performance.
The preceding discussion of the Company's results of operations includes        a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including the following:        Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization        (Adjusted EBITDA); gross profit, excluding significant charges;        operating expenses, excluding significant charges; and (loss) income        from operations, excluding significant charges. These non-GAAP measures        should not be viewed as alternatives or substitutes for GAAP reporting.
The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is        useful to investors because they are used by lenders to measure its        ability to service debt, by industry analysts to determine the market        value of the Company and by management to identify cash available to        service debt, make investments, maintain capital assets and fund ongoing        operations and working capital needs. Additionally, these measures allow        management to gauge company operating performance by isolating the        effects of significant charges.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income or loss from operations plus        income tax provision, interest expense, depreciation and amortization,        share based compensation expense, retail store impairment, and the        effects of significant charges (sale of slow moving inventory, and        internal investigation, litigation and professional fees), plus or minus        unrealized gain or loss on change in fair value of warrants and foreign        currency transaction gain or loss.
Gross profit, excluding significant charges, is calculated as gross        profit less significant charges related to the sale of slow moving        inventory, and internal investigation, litigation and professional fees.
Operating expenses excluding a significant charge is calculated as        operating expenses less significant charges related to the internal        investigation, litigation and professional fees.
Loss from operations excluding a significant charge is calculated as        loss from operations less a significant charge related to the sale of        slow moving inventory, and internal investigation, litigation and        professional fees.
