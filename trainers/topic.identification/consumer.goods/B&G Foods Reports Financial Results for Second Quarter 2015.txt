Please see “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Items Affecting            Comparability” below for the definition of the non-GAAP financial            measures “adjusted net income,” “adjusted diluted earnings per            share,” “base business net sales,” “comparable base business net            sales,” “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA” and “adjusted EBITDA margin,” as            well as information concerning certain items affecting comparability            and reconciliations of the non-GAAP terms to the most comparable            GAAP financial measures.
 
Commenting on the results, Robert C. Cantwell, President and Chief        Executive Officer of B&G Foods, stated, “During the quarter, the Company        achieved strong growth in adjusted net income of 8.4% and adjusted        EBITDA of 2.8%. We also continued our internal efforts to expand our        adjusted EBITDA margin* (already one of the industry’s        leading margins) through reduced promotional spending and cost        reductions, increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin 1.8 percentage points        to 24.5%. The quarter also included a successful equity offering that        reduced our net leverage and provided liquidity for acquisitions. With a        portion of the proceeds of the equity offering and consistent with our        continued commitment to pursue accretive acquisitions, we are pleased to        have begun the third quarter by acquiring Mama Mary’s, a        leading brand of shelf-stable pizza crusts that complements very well        our existing portfolio of products, including our Don Pepino pizza sauce. The acquisition is consistent with our long-standing        strategy of acquiring brands with strong category positioning at        accretive purchase price multiples.”
“We are also pleased that during the second quarter we were able to        enter into a strategic partnership with DSC Logistics to provide        warehousing and distribution management services at our three primary        distribution centers,” Mr. Cantwell continued. “We expect that the first        of the three distribution centers will transition during the third        quarter of 2015 and that after all three have transitioned by the end of        the second quarter of 2016, we will achieve cost savings of        approximately $8.0 million per year. As we move into the second half of        2015, we remain encouraged by the improvements we have made in our        already very strong adjusted EBITDA margin and are confident about        achieving our updated full year guidance for 2015.”
Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2015
Net sales for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 4.6% to $193.6        million from $202.9 million for the second quarter of 2014. Almost        two-thirds of the net sales decrease was attributable to Rickland Orchards. Net sales of the Rickland Orchards brand decreased        $6.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2014, a continuation of        the weakness that caused the Company to impair the brand’s trademark and        customer relationship intangible assets in 2014. Partially offsetting        the Rickland Orchards shortfall was an extra two weeks of sales        for Specialty Brands during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to        the second quarter of 2014, which positively impacted the Company’s net        sales by $1.0 million.
Comparable base business net sales, which excludes the impact of        acquisitions, the Rickland Orchards shortfall and the Ortega and Las Palmas recall announced in November 2014, decreased $3.8        million, or 1.9%, in the second quarter of 2015. The $3.8 million        decrease was attributable to a decrease in unit volume of $7.7 million,        partially offset by an increase in net pricing of $3.9 million (due to        increases in list prices and reduced promotional activity).
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $1.0 million, or        1.6%, to $62.0 million from $63.0 million for the second quarter of        2014. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to        32.0% in the second quarter of 2015 from 31.1% in the second quarter of        2014. The 0.9 percentage point increase resulted primarily from price        increases and lower delivery costs, partially offset by minor cost        increases in commodities and packaging and the negative impact of the        Canadian exchange rate.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.1 million, or        24.1%, to $19.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 from $25.3        million for the second quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily due        to decreases in acquisition-related expenses of $4.6 million, consumer        marketing of $1.1 million (primarily related to a reduction in demo        spending), selling expenses of $0.7 million (including a decrease of        $0.8 million for brokerage expenses, slightly offset by an increase in        salesperson compensation) and other expenses of $0.2 million. These        decreases were slightly offset by an increase of $0.5 million of        warehousing expenses. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, selling,        general and administrative expenses decreased 2.6 percentage points to        9.9% for the second quarter of 2015 from 12.5% for the second quarter of        2014.
Net interest expense for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.7        million, or 6.3%, to $11.1 million from $11.8 million in the second        quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease        in the Company’s average debt outstanding.
The Company’s reported net income under U.S. generally accepted        accounting principles (GAAP) was $18.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted        share, for the second quarter of 2015, as compared to reported net        income of $16.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the second        quarter of 2014. The Company’s adjusted net income for the second        quarter of 2015, which excludes the after tax impact of the loss on        product recall and acquisition-related expenses, was $19.0 million, or        $0.34 per adjusted diluted share. The Company’s adjusted net income for        the second quarter of 2014, which excludes the after tax impact of loss        on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses and the non-cash        gain relating to the Rickland Orchards earn-out was $17.5        million, or $0.33 per adjusted diluted share.
For the second quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the        impact of acquisition-related expenses and the loss on product recall,        increased 2.8% to $47.4 million from $46.1 million for the second        quarter of 2014.
Financial Results for the First Two Quarters of 2015
Net sales for the first two quarters of 2015 increased $9.7 million, or        2.4%, to $410.8 million from $401.0 million for the first two quarters        of 2014. Net sales of Specialty Brands, acquired in April 2014,        contributed $23.1 million to the overall increase. Net sales were        negatively impacted by the Rickland Orchards brand, whose net        sales decreased by $13.7 million compared to the first two quarters of        2014, a continuation of the weakness that caused the Company to impair        the brand’s trademark and customer relationship intangible assets in        2014.
Net sales of Ortega products increased $4.9 million, or 7.0%. The        increase was attributable to an increase in net pricing of $2.2 million        and an increase in unit volume due in part to customers restocking        inventory of products affected by the Ortega and Las Palmas recall,        partially offset by $1.2 million of customer refunds relating to the        recall.
Comparable base business net sales, which excludes the impact of        acquisitions, the Rickland Orchards shortfall and the Ortega and Las Palmas recall, increased $1.6 million, or 0.4% for the first        two quarters of 2015. The $1.6 million increase was attributable to an        increase in net pricing of $7.5 million (due to increases in list prices        and reduced promotional activity), offset by a decrease in unit volume        of $5.9 million.
Gross profit for the first two quarters of 2015 increased $1.7 million,        or 1.3%, to $129.4 million from $127.7 million for the first two        quarters of 2014. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales        decreased to 31.5% in the first two quarters of 2015 from 31.8% in the        first two quarters of 2014. The 0.3 percentage point decrease was        attributable primarily to customer refunds in the first two quarters of        2015 relating to the Ortega and Las Palmas recall and the        negative impact of the Canadian exchange rate. This reduction was        partially offset by the comparable base business net sales price        increase described above.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.9 million, or        12.2%, to $42.0 million for the first two quarters of 2015 from $47.9        million for the first two quarters of 2014. The decrease was primarily        due to decreases in acquisition-related expenses of $5.4 million and        consumer marketing of $3.3 million (related to a reduction in demo        spending), partially offset by increases in warehousing expenses of $1.3        million and other expenses of $1.5 million. Expressed as a percentage of        net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from        11.9% for the first two quarters of 2014 to 10.2% for the first two        quarters of 2015.
Net interest expense for the first two quarters of 2015 decreased $0.3        million, or 1.5%, to $22.6 million from $22.9 million in the first two        quarters of 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease        in the Company’s average debt outstanding.
The Company’s reported net income under GAAP was $38.3 million, or $0.69        per diluted share, for the first two quarters of 2015, as compared to        $33.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the first two quarters of        2014. The Company’s adjusted net income for the first two quarters of        2015, which excludes the after tax impact of the loss on product recall        and acquisition-related expenses, was $39.6 million, or $0.72 per        adjusted diluted share. The Company’s adjusted net income for the first        two quarters of 2014, which excludes the after tax impact of loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses and the non-cash        gain relating to the Rickland Orchards earn-out, was $35.8        million, or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share.
For the first two quarters of 2015, adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the        impact of acquisition-related expenses and the loss on product recall,        increased 5.2% to $97.3 million from $92.5 million for the first two        quarters of 2014.
Guidance
Primarily to take into account the expected impact of the recently        completed Mama Mary’s acquisition, B&G Foods increased its        adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2015 to a range of $199.0 million to        $204.0 million and net sales guidance to a range of $875.0 million to        $885.0 million. B&G Foods also decreased its adjusted diluted earnings        per share guidance for fiscal 2015 to a range of $1.44 to $1.50,        primarily due to an additional 4.2 million shares outstanding following        the Company’s second quarter 2015 public offering.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Items Affecting Comparability
“Adjusted net income,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “base        business net sales” (net sales without the impact of acquisitions until        the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods), “comparable        base business net sales” (base business net sales, excluding the Rickland        Orchards shortfall and the impact of the Ortega and Las        Palmas recall), “EBITDA” (net income before net interest expense,        income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment        of debt); “adjusted EBITDA” (EBITDA as adjusted for cash and non-cash        acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third        party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation        expenses); intangible asset impairment charges and related asset        write-offs; gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of        contingent liabilities from earn-outs; and loss on product recalls,        including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses        and the impact on cost of sales); and “adjusted EBITDA margin” (adjusted        EBITDA divided by net sales); are “non-GAAP financial measures.” A        non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial        performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than        the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in        accordance with GAAP in B&G Foods’ consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,        changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial        measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for        the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company’s non-GAAP        financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures        used by other companies.
The Company uses “adjusted net income,” “adjusted diluted earnings per        share,” “base business net sales” and “comparable base business net        sales,” which are calculated as reported net income, reported diluted        earnings per share and reported net sales adjusted for certain items        that affect comparability. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect        adjustments to reported net income, diluted earnings per share and net        sales to eliminate the items identified above. This information is        provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of        the Company’s operating performance between periods and to view the        Company’s business from the same perspective as the Company’s        management. Because the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of        these items, management does not consider these items when evaluating        the Company’s performance or when making decisions regarding allocation        of resources.
Additional information regarding EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and a        reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net        cash provided by operating activities is included below for the second        quarter and first two quarters of fiscal 2015 and 2014, along with the        components of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Also included below are        reconciliations of the non-GAAP terms adjusted net income, adjusted        diluted earnings per share, base business net sales and comparable base        business net sales to the most directly comparable measure calculated        and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company’s consolidated        balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations,        comprehensive income and cash flows.
