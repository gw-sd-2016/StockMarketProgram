MISSION VIEJO, CA--(Marketwired - February 13, 2015) - Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( AOLS ), a biotechnology company developing compounds to protect against radiological and chemical threats with significant funding from the US Government, announced today financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2014.
The Company reported a net loss of approximately $698,000, or $0.01 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2014. This compares to a net loss of $695,000, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2013. 
"During the quarter, we continued to make progress in the development of AEOL 10150 as a medical countermeasure against the pulmonary effects of Acute Radiation Syndrome ('Lung ARS') and we look forward to reaching several milestones over the next several months," stated John L. McManus, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We filed our response to the clinical hold placed on our Investigational New Drug Application ('IND') for Lung ARS by the Medical Imaging Products Division ('DMIP') of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') and will meet with them in March to confirm our path to initiating the phase I study of AEOL 10150 in healthy volunteers. We also expect to report the complete results from the NHP Efficacy study, as well as survival results from several mouse efficacy studies. In addition to the Lung ARS work, we expect to meet with the Oncology Division and the Respiratory Division of the FDA and then to file separate INDs to allow phase 1 studies in radiation oncology and pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal is to have clinical studies in multiple indications underway before the end of the year." 
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2014
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $925,000, versus revenue of $793,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2013. The revenue is from the contract with BARDA announced on February 11, 2011. Higher revenue in 2014 reflects the timing of the initiation of program items and revenue recognition under accounting rules.
Research and development expenses increased to approximately $973,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2014, from approximately $707,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2013. The increase in 2014 expenses reflects both the timing of program items under the BARDA and expense recognition under accounting rules.
General and administrative expenses were approximately $650,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2014 compared to approximately $781,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2013. The lower expense was due to reduced stock based compensation and reduced legal expenses.
As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $447,000 in cash and cash equivalents and 135,850,068 common shares outstanding. The Company had accounts receivable of $1,812,000 and accounts payable of $1,261,000 on December 31, 2014.
Aeolus has filed today with the SEC its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. Aeolus urges its investors to read this quarterly filing as well as its Annual Report on Form 10-K, also filed with the SEC, for further details concerning the Company.

About AEOL 10150
AEOL 10150 is a broad-spectrum catalytic antioxidant specifically designed to neutralize reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The neutralization of these species reduces oxidative stress, inflammation, and subsequent tissue damage-signaling cascades resulting from radiation exposure. AEOL 10150 may have a profound beneficial impact on people who have been exposed, or are about to be exposed, to high-doses of radiation in the treatment of oncology.
AEOL 10150 has performed well in preclinical and non-clinical studies, demonstrating statistically significant survival benefit in an acute radiation-induced lung injury model, and was well-tolerated in two human clinical trials. The Company believes it could have a profound beneficial impact on people who have been exposed, or are about to be exposed, to high-doses of radiation, whether from cancer therapy or a nuclear event.
About Aeolus Pharmaceuticals
Aeolus Pharmaceuticals is developing a platform of a new class of broad-spectrum, catalytic-antioxidant compounds that protect healthy tissue from the damaging effects of radiation. Its first compound, AEOL 10150, is being developed, with funding by the US Department of Health and Human Services, as a medical countermeasure against chemical and radiological weapons, where its initial target indications are as a protective agent against the effects of acute radiation syndrome and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure. Aeolus' strategy is to leverage the substantial investment in toxicology, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical studies made by US Government agencies in AEOL 10150, including the contract with BARDA valued, with options, at up to $118.4 million, to efficiently develop the compound for use in oncology. For more information, please visit Aeolus's corporate website at www.aolsrx.com .
