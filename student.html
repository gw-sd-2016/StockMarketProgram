						This is a stock market program that aims to analyze trends in press releases and tweets to determine the movement of a stock. The application will determine the sector of a stock based on it's press releases using training data. It will also extract the most significant terms for the company and use sentiment scores from tweets and sentences to create a prediction for future releases. Many other applications will use more complex mathematical approaches to project where a stock price could go, however this is a new and unique approach.
